As the principal of the private all boys school for the last thirty years, he had grown more and more determined to uphold the school's traditions and maintain its . He nodded at the boy. His eyes squinted behind the wire rimmed glasses as he glanced over the documents spread out before him. Sam Westlane kept his eyes cast down. The boy's shiny red hair was cut short and messily, ragged at the ends. His clothes were baggy and oversized, engulfing his small frame. He was clearly extremely shy and nervous, chewing his lip every two seconds. He sympathized with the boy. Finnigan was suddenly determined to help young Westlane out. Nodding briskly, he said, At least, what I believe should be a Crestan student . . Finnigan took a while to answer because he was momentarily stunned by the boy's beautiful, emerald green eyes and his pale, porcelain skin. The boy looked almost . . . feminine. Finnigan shook his head to clear his thoughts and frowned. Poor kid. Something tells me hes not just going to be bullied by the others for his financial status alone. Theyre going to drive him away by the end of the week, just like the last kid who came here on scholarship. What a shame. He seems like such a nice boy, too. Sam Westlane breathed a silent prayer. The ordeal was over. The school had accepted him. Headmaster Finnigan seemed like a nice, friendly man and she had felt a bit guilty for lying to him . . . but it was necessary. Her future depended on this step. Her fingers tightened instinctively as the memories she'd tried so hard to lock away resurfaced with a vengeance. Her parents' deaths in the car accident …her energetic brother now stuck in a coma like a living vegetable . . . her uncle taking her in . . . her uncle's vile treatmentof her for two years . . She'd finally run away after finding out that her desperate application to Crestan had been accepted. For days, she'd prayed that her uncle wouldn't find out and lock her away in the attic again, but luck was on her side. Her hands tightened on her bag, knuckles whitening. It was time that her life took a turn for the better. She changed her mind. Her bad luck was still running strong and fast. After getting her schedule and supplies, she found her dorm room. She really, really hoped her roommate was nice and not too attentive to details. Heaving another breath, she turned the doorknob. It was unlocked. His dark black hair was still damp from the shower and his clear gray eyes pierced into hers. Her gaze moved down to his bare, tanned chest and she felt her cheeks burning. He was evidently in the middle of changing. Thank god he had on a pair of blue jeans already. Stupid, stupid, stupid! Why didn't you knock? Stupid, stupid, stu -  She fell backward when the door abruptly opened. Stumbling, she crashed against something solidly warm and she heard a soft grunt. I'm an idiot. Vincent raised his eyebrow as he leaned against the doorframe. The tiny boy continued whispering his apologies, nearly bowing by the time he was finished. Vincent frowned as he studied his new roommate. This one's a nervous wreck. Should be easy enough to get rid of. Not like that nagging know-it-all who was here last time. This kid will be out of here by the end of the week. He sighed. Between them, it was their favorite game to either recruit the newbies onto their sides or kick them out. What was that about? So much for getting a nice roommate. She blew a wisp of her bangs out of her eyes in defeat and turned around. The room was neat, at least. Her roommate was surprisingly well organized for a boy. Huh. Then again, I don't have much to compare to. Dad, Terry, Uncle Frank . . . Her teeth clenched and once again, she turned her attention back to the room. Pressing her lips together, she straggled slowly over to her side of the room and began to put away her sparse possessions. Vincent strolled across the lawn, tucking his hands into his pockets. Vincent smiled, amused. They continued their way across the meticulously kept green field, the smell of freshly mown grass pungent in the air. He shrugged.

His dark black hair was still damp from the shower and his clear gray eyes pierced into hers. Her gaze moved down to his bare, tanned chest and she felt her cheeks burning. He was evidently in the middle of changing. Thank god he had on a pair of blue jeans already. Stupid, stupid, stupid! Why didn't you knock? Stupid, stupid, stu -  She fell backward when the door abruptly opened. Stumbling, she crashed against something solidly warm and she heard a soft grunt. I'm an idiot. Vincent raised his eyebrow as he leaned against the doorframe. The tiny boy continued whispering his apologies, nearly bowing by the time he was finished. Vincent frowned as he studied his new roommate. This one's a nervous wreck. Should be easy enough to get rid of. Not like that nagging know-it-all who was here last time. This kid will be out of here by the end of the week. He sighed. Between them, it was their favorite game to either recruit the newbies onto their sides or kick them out. What was that about? So much for getting a nice roommate. She blew a wisp of her bangs out of her eyes in defeat and turned around. The room was neat, at least. Her roommate was surprisingly well organized for a boy. Huh. Then again, I don't have much to compare to. Dad, Terry, Uncle Frank . . . Her teeth clenched and once again, she turned her attention back to the room. Pressing her lips together, she straggled slowly over to her side of the room and began to put away her sparse possessions. Vincent strolled across the lawn, tucking his hands into his pockets. Vincent smiled, amused. They continued their way across the meticulously kept green field, the smell of freshly mown grass pungent in the air. He shrugged. As the principal of the private all boys school for the last thirty years, he had grown more and more determined to uphold the school's traditions and maintain its . He nodded at the boy. His eyes squinted behind the wire rimmed glasses as he glanced over the documents spread out before him. Sam Westlane kept his eyes cast down. The boy's shiny red hair was cut short and messily, ragged at the ends. His clothes were baggy and oversized, engulfing his small frame. He was clearly extremely shy and nervous, chewing his lip every two seconds. He sympathized with the boy. Finnigan was suddenly determined to help young Westlane out. Nodding briskly, he said, At least, what I believe should be a Crestan student . . Finnigan took a while to answer because he was momentarily stunned by the boy's beautiful, emerald green eyes and his pale, porcelain skin. The boy looked almost . . . feminine. Finnigan shook his head to clear his thoughts and frowned. Poor kid. Something tells me hes not just going to be bullied by the others for his financial status alone. Theyre going to drive him away by the end of the week, just like the last kid who came here on scholarship. What a shame. He seems like such a nice boy, too. Sam Westlane breathed a silent prayer. The ordeal was over. The school had accepted him. Headmaster Finnigan seemed like a nice, friendly man and she had felt a bit guilty for lying to him . . . but it was necessary. Her future depended on this step. Her fingers tightened instinctively as the memories she'd tried so hard to lock away resurfaced with a vengeance. Her parents' deaths in the car accident …her energetic brother now stuck in a coma like a living vegetable . . . her uncle taking her in . . . her uncle's vile treatmentof her for two years . . She'd finally run away after finding out that her desperate application to Crestan had been accepted. For days, she'd prayed that her uncle wouldn't find out and lock her away in the attic again, but luck was on her side. Her hands tightened on her bag, knuckles whitening.

He was clearly extremely shy and nervous, chewing his lip every two seconds. He sympathized with the boy. Finnigan was suddenly determined to help young Westlane out. Nodding briskly, he said, At least, what I believe should be a Crestan student . . Finnigan took a while to answer because he was momentarily stunned by the boy's beautiful, emerald green eyes and his pale, porcelain skin. The boy looked almost . . . feminine. Finnigan shook his head to clear his thoughts and frowned. Poor kid. Something tells me hes not just going to be bullied by the others for his financial status alone. Theyre going to drive him away by the end of the week, just like the last kid who came here on scholarship. What a shame. He seems like such a nice boy, too. Sam Westlane breathed a silent prayer. The ordeal was over. The school had accepted him. Headmaster Finnigan seemed like a nice, friendly man and she had felt a bit guilty for lying to him . . . but it was necessary. Her future depended on this step. Her fingers tightened instinctively as the memories she'd tried so hard to lock away resurfaced with a vengeance. Her parents' deaths in the car accident …her energetic brother now stuck in a coma like a living vegetable . . . her uncle taking her in . . . her uncle's vile treatmentof her for two years . . She'd finally run away after finding out that her desperate application to Crestan had been accepted. For days, she'd prayed that her uncle wouldn't find out and lock her away in the attic again, but luck was on her side. Her hands tightened on her bag, knuckles whitening. It was time that her life took a turn for the better. She changed her mind. Her bad luck was still running strong and fast. After getting her schedule and supplies, she found her dorm room. She really, really hoped her roommate was nice and not too attentive to details. Heaving another breath, she turned the doorknob. It was unlocked. His dark black hair was still damp from the shower and his clear gray eyes pierced into hers. Her gaze moved down to his bare, tanned chest and she felt her cheeks burning. He was evidently in the middle of changing. Thank god he had on a pair of blue jeans already. Stupid, stupid, stupid! Why didn't you knock? Stupid, stupid, stu -  She fell backward when the door abruptly opened. Stumbling, she crashed against something solidly warm and she heard a soft grunt. I'm an idiot. Vincent raised his eyebrow as he leaned against the doorframe. The tiny boy continued whispering his apologies, nearly bowing by the time he was finished. Vincent frowned as he studied his new roommate. This one's a nervous wreck. Should be easy enough to get rid of. Not like that nagging know-it-all who was here last time. This kid will be out of here by the end of the week. He sighed. Between them, it was their favorite game to either recruit the newbies onto their sides or kick them out. What was that about? So much for getting a nice roommate. She blew a wisp of her bangs out of her eyes in defeat and turned around. The room was neat, at least. Her roommate was surprisingly well organized for a boy. Huh. Then again, I don't have much to compare to. Dad, Terry, Uncle Frank . . . Her teeth clenched and once again, she turned her attention back to the room. Pressing her lips together, she straggled slowly over to her side of the room and began to put away her sparse possessions. Vincent strolled across the lawn, tucking his hands into his pockets. Vincent smiled, amused. They continued their way across the meticulously kept green field, the smell of freshly mown grass pungent in the air. He shrugged.

She's sweet and smart and has a shoulder for anyone to cry on. A big romantic and severely lacking in the guy department. He's smart, sexy, and can charm any girl with a pulse. Any girl except Sam, that is. When they're made to work together for the school fundraiser, he'll make her see that there's a fine line between love and hate. She's got everything – money, looks, smarts, personality. But this year, her friends will find out that there's much more than meets the eye to Madison. Perhaps she doesn't have everything. Laid-back and laconic, Ian is one of Sam's closest friends, and she is one of the most precious people in his life. But when Ian makes a startling discovery, his friendship with Sam is put to the test. Also Sam's overprotective stepbrother. Scott's used to being shifted off to the side, to being second-string. He's used to temporary, not permanent. Then he starts having some intense not-so-platonic feelings for the one person he can't have. As they near closer and closer to graduation, hormones go into overdrive, friendships are tested, bonds are formed, and ties are severed. They will learn that family isn't just blood. It's much more than that. But ducks sound so much more interesting than trees. ). I'm just… quirky. Quirky and eccentric. Samantha Spade. Yeah, I know. . . One of the many students at Maple Ridge Academy. What is Maple Ridge, you ask? Well, as the student body so lovingly refers to it as, Maple Ridge is the school for the rich and unwanted. See, time was, you used to have to have some kick-ass talent to get into MR. Now, you just have to have a shitload of money to be able to pay the extortionist-like tuition fees (seriously, I could live off one year's tuition for the rest of my natural-born days). No longer is it a school for the exceptionally gifted and talented. Madison, well, what can I say about her? She's perfection personified, in my opinion. She's incredibly kind, she's incredibly intelligent, she's incredibly beautiful in the classic sense (think killer long legs, beautiful sky blue eyes, bright blonde hair, and impeccably flawless skin – she's been named one of the top five most gorgeous people on campus three years in a row already), and she's the Student Council President, co-captain of the cheerleading team, and a proud member of the Science Club. He's our resident basketball star. In fact, basketball's how he got to come to MR. See, unlike ninety-two-percent of the school population, Ian came on a scholarship. His dad passed away when he was eight, and his mother had to work two jobs to support him and his younger brother. He was able to get a full scholarship to Maple Ridge, and of course, he took it. He's, what, six-foot-five? Yeah, he's mad tall. He's got thick, wavy hair that's the most interesting shade of brown. It's so cool; if the light hits it just right, you can see strands of gold. His eyes are the most captivating shade of blue; Madison once said the exact shade was cerulean. And when he gets excited or something, you can see little slivers of navy or light blue. He has, by far, the nicest eyes I've ever seen. See, for as long as I could remember, it was Alan, Amanda, I, and Mom. We weren't exactly poor, but Mom had to work her ass off like, twenty-four-seven. It didn't help that Amanda is about the most materialistic and shallow person to ever grace this earth. When Mom got engaged to Adam, I have to admit, even I got sucked in by the whole luxury lifestyle. She's milking it for all it's worth. And Adam seems to genuinely enjoy spoiling her; I guess she's the little princess he never had. Mom and Adam got married the May that I was in the eighth grade, so by the end of the summer, they figured it would be less hassle (on them) if they just sent me to MR for my high school years, like Adam did with Scott. But physical similarities aside, we're both highly opinionated (we have many a debate together), passionate about the things we love, have bad tempers (it takes a lot to really piss me off, but when I get mad…), and love chocolate chip ice cream. Scott used to detest me (he met Amanda first, and pretty much assumed I was as bitchy as my younger sister), and I wasn't exactly fond of him, either. Trust me, you wouldn't exactly be best friends with a guy whose boxers and other unmentionables you found all over your living room one Saturday morning. But then when we discovered the other liked BtVS as much as we each did, Tuesday night at eight became our time, and we gradually shed our judgments and stereotypes of one another. Oh, right. Sorry, got a little sidetracked. I do that often. So I got sent off to Maple at the beginning of ninth grade, and I pretty much lost contact with all of my friends, except for my lifelong best, Leah Green. You would think she'd be upset that her twin and older sister (who practically raised her, while Mom was at work) got booted off to boarding school. Alan's still got another three years after this, and I know it'll be weird for him without me around. I'll miss him, too. I'm glad he's managed to make genuine friends, though, like I have. There have been a couple of girls who tried to befriend me, just to get a date with Scott or Ian, but that was back in tenth grade, when I was young and naïve. Thank goodness I know better, now. I detest him. I loathe him. I despise him about as much as I love Buffy. That is how much I do not like him. But alas, I'm constantly forced to see him, since he's been Maddy's friend since they were in diapers, and he's pretty cool with Alan, too. He and Scott are like brothers though, which irks me to no end. How my brother can be so close with the Son of the Devil is beyond me. The time he came 'round when Leah was visiting, even she liked him. I'd never been hit on before, so naturally, it was a little shocking. And, I'm not afraid to admit this (because all it means, really, is that I have eyes), but David was – is – handsome. I would even go as far as to say he's a hottie. Of course, I'd have to be drunk to say that in mixed company, but you get what I mean. See, unlike the public schools in Toronto, which are pleasantly diverse, you could count the amount of non-Caucasian people with both hands. Besides myself, my brother, and David, there's I think one or two more Guyanese people. I'd rather be off-topic, though, if I'm going to have to describe David Weston's physical features. Okay, we've got thick black hair that always looks tousled, though I guess on him, it works. He's got nice eyes, too, I suppose. They're a deep shade of brown, almost black, and sometimes you can see flecks of golden brown. I see it a lot when we argue, so I guess it's when he's pissed that his eyes go like that. He's got a strong jaw, and he's built, but not overly so. He's, well, I guess you could say he's got the body of a track star and a football star combined. That may be because he is both a track star and a football star. He's pretty cute, I guess… if you go for that whole tall, dark, and handsome thing. And now back to why we don't get along. After he (rather crudely) hit on me, I (rather loudly) told him off. Then he insulted me, so I insulted him back (I may be quiet a lot of the time, but like I said, when I get mad, I give as good as I get). Thus began our three-year-long feud. Scott, Alan, and I usually make the three-hour-long drive up north as soon as we can, because we really don't like being at home with the parents and Mandy. But this year, we all went on a vacation to the Big Apple to spend some 'quality time' together, seeing as we apparently never do that anymore. So, the first day back at Maple. Madison, who had arrived the day before me, had already finished settling in, and was lying on her stomach on her plush queen-sized bed, leafing through the latest issue of Teen People that I'd gotten the other day. Yes, we may be the unwanted, but we're highly compensated for it. There's only one person that we know who comes to the window when he visits us. Keeping silent, I moved out from the closet, and began to pack away my books. I have a whole trunk of them. Books, that is. At the end of every year, I have to empty my shelves, and then I have to repack them in September. I'm one of the few students who actually use their bookshelves for books. In fact, I have so many books, that Maddy graciously gave me her shelf space. It usually takes me a couple of hours to pack everything back, if I have help. Usually, I do. I could just imagine Weston's face. I'm not the sadist of the two of us. Well, whenever one goes on vacation, the other one tags along. This year, I guess I kind of broke their tradition. I guess I do that a lot. Not that I particularly like Weston to think that I'm trying to steal his best friend away. Not that I even care what he thinks. It's just, I know how hard it is when it feels like your friends are abandoning you. At five-foot-seven, I was used to being tall. Up until the end of tenth grade, that is. I don't usually swear, but he always finds it so funny when I do. I clenched my teeth. When the arrogant asshole couldn't get me pissed off one way, he always did the sexual innuendo thing. I smiled, satisfied. I chirped. My eyes flicked over to Weston's bruised temple. I added, my voice laced with mock-concern. I shrieked and pulled the door shut as he bolted from the bed, his eyes filled with fury. She's sweet and smart and has a shoulder for anyone to cry on. A big romantic and severely lacking in the guy department. He's smart, sexy, and can charm any girl with a pulse. Any girl except Sam, that is. When they're made to work together for the school fundraiser, he'll make her see that there's a fine line between love and hate. She's got everything – money, looks, smarts, personality. But this year, her friends will find out that there's much more than meets the eye to Madison. Perhaps she doesn't have everything. Laid-back and laconic, Ian is one of Sam's closest friends, and she is one of the most precious people in his life. But when Ian makes a startling discovery, his friendship with Sam is put to the test. Also Sam's overprotective stepbrother. Scott's used to being shifted off to the side, to being second-string. He's used to temporary, not permanent. Then he starts having some intense not-so-platonic feelings for the one person he can't have. As they near closer and closer to graduation, hormones go into overdrive, friendships are tested, bonds are formed, and ties are severed. They will learn that family isn't just blood. It's much more than that. But ducks sound so much more interesting than trees. ). I'm just… quirky. Quirky and eccentric. Samantha Spade. Yeah, I know. . . One of the many students at Maple Ridge Academy. What is Maple Ridge, you ask? Well, as the student body so lovingly refers to it as, Maple Ridge is the school for the rich and unwanted. See, time was, you used to have to have some kick-ass talent to get into MR. Now, you just have to have a shitload of money to be able to pay the extortionist-like tuition fees (seriously, I could live off one year's tuition for the rest of my natural-born days). No longer is it a school for the exceptionally gifted and talented. Madison, well, what can I say about her? She's perfection personified, in my opinion. She's incredibly kind, she's incredibly intelligent, she's incredibly beautiful in the classic sense (think killer long legs, beautiful sky blue eyes, bright blonde hair, and impeccably flawless skin – she's been named one of the top five most gorgeous people on campus three years in a row already), and she's the Student Council President, co-captain of the cheerleading team, and a proud member of the Science Club.

But alas, I'm constantly forced to see him, since he's been Maddy's friend since they were in diapers, and he's pretty cool with Alan, too. He and Scott are like brothers though, which irks me to no end. How my brother can be so close with the Son of the Devil is beyond me. The time he came 'round when Leah was visiting, even she liked him. I'd never been hit on before, so naturally, it was a little shocking. And, I'm not afraid to admit this (because all it means, really, is that I have eyes), but David was – is – handsome. I would even go as far as to say he's a hottie. Of course, I'd have to be drunk to say that in mixed company, but you get what I mean. See, unlike the public schools in Toronto, which are pleasantly diverse, you could count the amount of non-Caucasian people with both hands. Besides myself, my brother, and David, there's I think one or two more Guyanese people. I'd rather be off-topic, though, if I'm going to have to describe David Weston's physical features. Okay, we've got thick black hair that always looks tousled, though I guess on him, it works. He's got nice eyes, too, I suppose. They're a deep shade of brown, almost black, and sometimes you can see flecks of golden brown. I see it a lot when we argue, so I guess it's when he's pissed that his eyes go like that. He's got a strong jaw, and he's built, but not overly so. He's, well, I guess you could say he's got the body of a track star and a football star combined. That may be because he is both a track star and a football star. He's pretty cute, I guess… if you go for that whole tall, dark, and handsome thing. And now back to why we don't get along. After he (rather crudely) hit on me, I (rather loudly) told him off. Then he insulted me, so I insulted him back (I may be quiet a lot of the time, but like I said, when I get mad, I give as good as I get). Thus began our three-year-long feud. Scott, Alan, and I usually make the three-hour-long drive up north as soon as we can, because we really don't like being at home with the parents and Mandy. But this year, we all went on a vacation to the Big Apple to spend some 'quality time' together, seeing as we apparently never do that anymore. So, the first day back at Maple. Madison, who had arrived the day before me, had already finished settling in, and was lying on her stomach on her plush queen-sized bed, leafing through the latest issue of Teen People that I'd gotten the other day. Yes, we may be the unwanted, but we're highly compensated for it. There's only one person that we know who comes to the window when he visits us. Keeping silent, I moved out from the closet, and began to pack away my books. I have a whole trunk of them. Books, that is. At the end of every year, I have to empty my shelves, and then I have to repack them in September. I'm one of the few students who actually use their bookshelves for books. In fact, I have so many books, that Maddy graciously gave me her shelf space. It usually takes me a couple of hours to pack everything back, if I have help. Usually, I do. I could just imagine Weston's face. I'm not the sadist of the two of us. Well, whenever one goes on vacation, the other one tags along. This year, I guess I kind of broke their tradition. I guess I do that a lot. Not that I particularly like Weston to think that I'm trying to steal his best friend away. Not that I even care what he thinks. It's just, I know how hard it is when it feels like your friends are abandoning you. At five-foot-seven, I was used to being tall. Up until the end of tenth grade, that is. I don't usually swear, but he always finds it so funny when I do. I clenched my teeth. When the arrogant asshole couldn't get me pissed off one way, he always did the sexual innuendo thing. I smiled, satisfied. I chirped. My eyes flicked over to Weston's bruised temple. I added, my voice laced with mock-concern. I shrieked and pulled the door shut as he bolted from the bed, his eyes filled with fury. She's sweet and smart and has a shoulder for anyone to cry on. A big romantic and severely lacking in the guy department. He's smart, sexy, and can charm any girl with a pulse. Any girl except Sam, that is. When they're made to work together for the school fundraiser, he'll make her see that there's a fine line between love and hate. She's got everything – money, looks, smarts, personality. But this year, her friends will find out that there's much more than meets the eye to Madison. Perhaps she doesn't have everything. Laid-back and laconic, Ian is one of Sam's closest friends, and she is one of the most precious people in his life. But when Ian makes a startling discovery, his friendship with Sam is put to the test. Also Sam's overprotective stepbrother. Scott's used to being shifted off to the side, to being second-string. He's used to temporary, not permanent. Then he starts having some intense not-so-platonic feelings for the one person he can't have. As they near closer and closer to graduation, hormones go into overdrive, friendships are tested, bonds are formed, and ties are severed. They will learn that family isn't just blood. It's much more than that. But ducks sound so much more interesting than trees. ). I'm just… quirky. Quirky and eccentric. Samantha Spade. Yeah, I know. . . One of the many students at Maple Ridge Academy. What is Maple Ridge, you ask? Well, as the student body so lovingly refers to it as, Maple Ridge is the school for the rich and unwanted. See, time was, you used to have to have some kick-ass talent to get into MR. Now, you just have to have a shitload of money to be able to pay the extortionist-like tuition fees (seriously, I could live off one year's tuition for the rest of my natural-born days). No longer is it a school for the exceptionally gifted and talented. Madison, well, what can I say about her? She's perfection personified, in my opinion. She's incredibly kind, she's incredibly intelligent, she's incredibly beautiful in the classic sense (think killer long legs, beautiful sky blue eyes, bright blonde hair, and impeccably flawless skin – she's been named one of the top five most gorgeous people on campus three years in a row already), and she's the Student Council President, co-captain of the cheerleading team, and a proud member of the Science Club. He's our resident basketball star. In fact, basketball's how he got to come to MR. See, unlike ninety-two-percent of the school population, Ian came on a scholarship. His dad passed away when he was eight, and his mother had to work two jobs to support him and his younger brother. He was able to get a full scholarship to Maple Ridge, and of course, he took it. He's, what, six-foot-five? Yeah, he's mad tall. He's got thick, wavy hair that's the most interesting shade of brown. It's so cool; if the light hits it just right, you can see strands of gold. His eyes are the most captivating shade of blue; Madison once said the exact shade was cerulean. And when he gets excited or something, you can see little slivers of navy or light blue. He has, by far, the nicest eyes I've ever seen. See, for as long as I could remember, it was Alan, Amanda, I, and Mom. We weren't exactly poor, but Mom had to work her ass off like, twenty-four-seven. It didn't help that Amanda is about the most materialistic and shallow person to ever grace this earth. When Mom got engaged to Adam, I have to admit, even I got sucked in by the whole luxury lifestyle. She's milking it for all it's worth. And Adam seems to genuinely enjoy spoiling her; I guess she's the little princess he never had. Mom and Adam got married the May that I was in the eighth grade, so by the end of the summer, they figured it would be less hassle (on them) if they just sent me to MR for my high school years, like Adam did with Scott. But physical similarities aside, we're both highly opinionated (we have many a debate together), passionate about the things we love, have bad tempers (it takes a lot to really piss me off, but when I get mad…), and love chocolate chip ice cream. Scott used to detest me (he met Amanda first, and pretty much assumed I was as bitchy as my younger sister), and I wasn't exactly fond of him, either. Trust me, you wouldn't exactly be best friends with a guy whose boxers and other unmentionables you found all over your living room one Saturday morning. But then when we discovered the other liked BtVS as much as we each did, Tuesday night at eight became our time, and we gradually shed our judgments and stereotypes of one another. Oh, right. Sorry, got a little sidetracked. I do that often. So I got sent off to Maple at the beginning of ninth grade, and I pretty much lost contact with all of my friends, except for my lifelong best, Leah Green. You would think she'd be upset that her twin and older sister (who practically raised her, while Mom was at work) got booted off to boarding school. Alan's still got another three years after this, and I know it'll be weird for him without me around. I'll miss him, too. I'm glad he's managed to make genuine friends, though, like I have. There have been a couple of girls who tried to befriend me, just to get a date with Scott or Ian, but that was back in tenth grade, when I was young and naïve. Thank goodness I know better, now.

In fact, I have so many books, that Maddy graciously gave me her shelf space. It usually takes me a couple of hours to pack everything back, if I have help. Usually, I do. I could just imagine Weston's face. I'm not the sadist of the two of us. Well, whenever one goes on vacation, the other one tags along. This year, I guess I kind of broke their tradition. I guess I do that a lot. Not that I particularly like Weston to think that I'm trying to steal his best friend away. Not that I even care what he thinks. It's just, I know how hard it is when it feels like your friends are abandoning you. At five-foot-seven, I was used to being tall. Up until the end of tenth grade, that is. I don't usually swear, but he always finds it so funny when I do. I clenched my teeth. When the arrogant asshole couldn't get me pissed off one way, he always did the sexual innuendo thing. I smiled, satisfied. I chirped. My eyes flicked over to Weston's bruised temple. I added, my voice laced with mock-concern. I shrieked and pulled the door shut as he bolted from the bed, his eyes filled with fury. She's sweet and smart and has a shoulder for anyone to cry on. A big romantic and severely lacking in the guy department. He's smart, sexy, and can charm any girl with a pulse. Any girl except Sam, that is. When they're made to work together for the school fundraiser, he'll make her see that there's a fine line between love and hate. She's got everything – money, looks, smarts, personality. But this year, her friends will find out that there's much more than meets the eye to Madison. Perhaps she doesn't have everything. Laid-back and laconic, Ian is one of Sam's closest friends, and she is one of the most precious people in his life. But when Ian makes a startling discovery, his friendship with Sam is put to the test. Also Sam's overprotective stepbrother. Scott's used to being shifted off to the side, to being second-string. He's used to temporary, not permanent. Then he starts having some intense not-so-platonic feelings for the one person he can't have. As they near closer and closer to graduation, hormones go into overdrive, friendships are tested, bonds are formed, and ties are severed. They will learn that family isn't just blood. It's much more than that. But ducks sound so much more interesting than trees. ). I'm just… quirky. Quirky and eccentric. Samantha Spade. Yeah, I know. . . One of the many students at Maple Ridge Academy. What is Maple Ridge, you ask? Well, as the student body so lovingly refers to it as, Maple Ridge is the school for the rich and unwanted. See, time was, you used to have to have some kick-ass talent to get into MR. Now, you just have to have a shitload of money to be able to pay the extortionist-like tuition fees (seriously, I could live off one year's tuition for the rest of my natural-born days). No longer is it a school for the exceptionally gifted and talented. Madison, well, what can I say about her? She's perfection personified, in my opinion. She's incredibly kind, she's incredibly intelligent, she's incredibly beautiful in the classic sense (think killer long legs, beautiful sky blue eyes, bright blonde hair, and impeccably flawless skin – she's been named one of the top five most gorgeous people on campus three years in a row already), and she's the Student Council President, co-captain of the cheerleading team, and a proud member of the Science Club. He's our resident basketball star. In fact, basketball's how he got to come to MR. See, unlike ninety-two-percent of the school population, Ian came on a scholarship. His dad passed away when he was eight, and his mother had to work two jobs to support him and his younger brother. He was able to get a full scholarship to Maple Ridge, and of course, he took it. He's, what, six-foot-five? Yeah, he's mad tall. He's got thick, wavy hair that's the most interesting shade of brown. It's so cool; if the light hits it just right, you can see strands of gold. His eyes are the most captivating shade of blue; Madison once said the exact shade was cerulean. And when he gets excited or something, you can see little slivers of navy or light blue. He has, by far, the nicest eyes I've ever seen. See, for as long as I could remember, it was Alan, Amanda, I, and Mom. We weren't exactly poor, but Mom had to work her ass off like, twenty-four-seven. It didn't help that Amanda is about the most materialistic and shallow person to ever grace this earth. When Mom got engaged to Adam, I have to admit, even I got sucked in by the whole luxury lifestyle. She's milking it for all it's worth. And Adam seems to genuinely enjoy spoiling her; I guess she's the little princess he never had. Mom and Adam got married the May that I was in the eighth grade, so by the end of the summer, they figured it would be less hassle (on them) if they just sent me to MR for my high school years, like Adam did with Scott. But physical similarities aside, we're both highly opinionated (we have many a debate together), passionate about the things we love, have bad tempers (it takes a lot to really piss me off, but when I get mad…), and love chocolate chip ice cream. Scott used to detest me (he met Amanda first, and pretty much assumed I was as bitchy as my younger sister), and I wasn't exactly fond of him, either. Trust me, you wouldn't exactly be best friends with a guy whose boxers and other unmentionables you found all over your living room one Saturday morning. But then when we discovered the other liked BtVS as much as we each did, Tuesday night at eight became our time, and we gradually shed our judgments and stereotypes of one another. Oh, right. Sorry, got a little sidetracked. I do that often. So I got sent off to Maple at the beginning of ninth grade, and I pretty much lost contact with all of my friends, except for my lifelong best, Leah Green. You would think she'd be upset that her twin and older sister (who practically raised her, while Mom was at work) got booted off to boarding school. Alan's still got another three years after this, and I know it'll be weird for him without me around. I'll miss him, too. I'm glad he's managed to make genuine friends, though, like I have. There have been a couple of girls who tried to befriend me, just to get a date with Scott or Ian, but that was back in tenth grade, when I was young and naïve. Thank goodness I know better, now. I detest him. I loathe him. I despise him about as much as I love Buffy. That is how much I do not like him. But alas, I'm constantly forced to see him, since he's been Maddy's friend since they were in diapers, and he's pretty cool with Alan, too. He and Scott are like brothers though, which irks me to no end. How my brother can be so close with the Son of the Devil is beyond me. The time he came 'round when Leah was visiting, even she liked him. I'd never been hit on before, so naturally, it was a little shocking. And, I'm not afraid to admit this (because all it means, really, is that I have eyes), but David was – is – handsome. I would even go as far as to say he's a hottie. Of course, I'd have to be drunk to say that in mixed company, but you get what I mean. See, unlike the public schools in Toronto, which are pleasantly diverse, you could count the amount of non-Caucasian people with both hands. Besides myself, my brother, and David, there's I think one or two more Guyanese people. I'd rather be off-topic, though, if I'm going to have to describe David Weston's physical features. Okay, we've got thick black hair that always looks tousled, though I guess on him, it works. He's got nice eyes, too, I suppose. They're a deep shade of brown, almost black, and sometimes you can see flecks of golden brown. I see it a lot when we argue, so I guess it's when he's pissed that his eyes go like that. He's got a strong jaw, and he's built, but not overly so. He's, well, I guess you could say he's got the body of a track star and a football star combined. That may be because he is both a track star and a football star. He's pretty cute, I guess… if you go for that whole tall, dark, and handsome thing. And now back to why we don't get along. After he (rather crudely) hit on me, I (rather loudly) told him off. Then he insulted me, so I insulted him back (I may be quiet a lot of the time, but like I said, when I get mad, I give as good as I get). Thus began our three-year-long feud. Scott, Alan, and I usually make the three-hour-long drive up north as soon as we can, because we really don't like being at home with the parents and Mandy. But this year, we all went on a vacation to the Big Apple to spend some 'quality time' together, seeing as we apparently never do that anymore. So, the first day back at Maple. Madison, who had arrived the day before me, had already finished settling in, and was lying on her stomach on her plush queen-sized bed, leafing through the latest issue of Teen People that I'd gotten the other day. Yes, we may be the unwanted, but we're highly compensated for it. There's only one person that we know who comes to the window when he visits us. Keeping silent, I moved out from the closet, and began to pack away my books. I have a whole trunk of them. Books, that is.

She's incredibly kind, she's incredibly intelligent, she's incredibly beautiful in the classic sense (think killer long legs, beautiful sky blue eyes, bright blonde hair, and impeccably flawless skin – she's been named one of the top five most gorgeous people on campus three years in a row already), and she's the Student Council President, co-captain of the cheerleading team, and a proud member of the Science Club. He's our resident basketball star. In fact, basketball's how he got to come to MR. See, unlike ninety-two-percent of the school population, Ian came on a scholarship. His dad passed away when he was eight, and his mother had to work two jobs to support him and his younger brother. He was able to get a full scholarship to Maple Ridge, and of course, he took it. He's, what, six-foot-five? Yeah, he's mad tall. He's got thick, wavy hair that's the most interesting shade of brown. It's so cool; if the light hits it just right, you can see strands of gold. His eyes are the most captivating shade of blue; Madison once said the exact shade was cerulean. And when he gets excited or something, you can see little slivers of navy or light blue. He has, by far, the nicest eyes I've ever seen. See, for as long as I could remember, it was Alan, Amanda, I, and Mom. We weren't exactly poor, but Mom had to work her ass off like, twenty-four-seven. It didn't help that Amanda is about the most materialistic and shallow person to ever grace this earth. When Mom got engaged to Adam, I have to admit, even I got sucked in by the whole luxury lifestyle. She's milking it for all it's worth. And Adam seems to genuinely enjoy spoiling her; I guess she's the little princess he never had. Mom and Adam got married the May that I was in the eighth grade, so by the end of the summer, they figured it would be less hassle (on them) if they just sent me to MR for my high school years, like Adam did with Scott. But physical similarities aside, we're both highly opinionated (we have many a debate together), passionate about the things we love, have bad tempers (it takes a lot to really piss me off, but when I get mad…), and love chocolate chip ice cream. Scott used to detest me (he met Amanda first, and pretty much assumed I was as bitchy as my younger sister), and I wasn't exactly fond of him, either. Trust me, you wouldn't exactly be best friends with a guy whose boxers and other unmentionables you found all over your living room one Saturday morning. But then when we discovered the other liked BtVS as much as we each did, Tuesday night at eight became our time, and we gradually shed our judgments and stereotypes of one another. Oh, right. Sorry, got a little sidetracked. I do that often. So I got sent off to Maple at the beginning of ninth grade, and I pretty much lost contact with all of my friends, except for my lifelong best, Leah Green. You would think she'd be upset that her twin and older sister (who practically raised her, while Mom was at work) got booted off to boarding school. Alan's still got another three years after this, and I know it'll be weird for him without me around. I'll miss him, too. I'm glad he's managed to make genuine friends, though, like I have. There have been a couple of girls who tried to befriend me, just to get a date with Scott or Ian, but that was back in tenth grade, when I was young and naïve. Thank goodness I know better, now. I detest him. I loathe him. I despise him about as much as I love Buffy. That is how much I do not like him. But alas, I'm constantly forced to see him, since he's been Maddy's friend since they were in diapers, and he's pretty cool with Alan, too. He and Scott are like brothers though, which irks me to no end. How my brother can be so close with the Son of the Devil is beyond me. The time he came 'round when Leah was visiting, even she liked him. I'd never been hit on before, so naturally, it was a little shocking. And, I'm not afraid to admit this (because all it means, really, is that I have eyes), but David was – is – handsome. I would even go as far as to say he's a hottie. Of course, I'd have to be drunk to say that in mixed company, but you get what I mean. See, unlike the public schools in Toronto, which are pleasantly diverse, you could count the amount of non-Caucasian people with both hands. Besides myself, my brother, and David, there's I think one or two more Guyanese people. I'd rather be off-topic, though, if I'm going to have to describe David Weston's physical features. Okay, we've got thick black hair that always looks tousled, though I guess on him, it works. He's got nice eyes, too, I suppose. They're a deep shade of brown, almost black, and sometimes you can see flecks of golden brown. I see it a lot when we argue, so I guess it's when he's pissed that his eyes go like that. He's got a strong jaw, and he's built, but not overly so. He's, well, I guess you could say he's got the body of a track star and a football star combined. That may be because he is both a track star and a football star. He's pretty cute, I guess… if you go for that whole tall, dark, and handsome thing. And now back to why we don't get along. After he (rather crudely) hit on me, I (rather loudly) told him off. Then he insulted me, so I insulted him back (I may be quiet a lot of the time, but like I said, when I get mad, I give as good as I get). Thus began our three-year-long feud. Scott, Alan, and I usually make the three-hour-long drive up north as soon as we can, because we really don't like being at home with the parents and Mandy. But this year, we all went on a vacation to the Big Apple to spend some 'quality time' together, seeing as we apparently never do that anymore. So, the first day back at Maple. Madison, who had arrived the day before me, had already finished settling in, and was lying on her stomach on her plush queen-sized bed, leafing through the latest issue of Teen People that I'd gotten the other day. Yes, we may be the unwanted, but we're highly compensated for it. There's only one person that we know who comes to the window when he visits us. Keeping silent, I moved out from the closet, and began to pack away my books. I have a whole trunk of them. Books, that is. At the end of every year, I have to empty my shelves, and then I have to repack them in September. I'm one of the few students who actually use their bookshelves for books. In fact, I have so many books, that Maddy graciously gave me her shelf space. It usually takes me a couple of hours to pack everything back, if I have help. Usually, I do. I could just imagine Weston's face. I'm not the sadist of the two of us. Well, whenever one goes on vacation, the other one tags along. This year, I guess I kind of broke their tradition. I guess I do that a lot. Not that I particularly like Weston to think that I'm trying to steal his best friend away. Not that I even care what he thinks. It's just, I know how hard it is when it feels like your friends are abandoning you. At five-foot-seven, I was used to being tall. Up until the end of tenth grade, that is. I don't usually swear, but he always finds it so funny when I do. I clenched my teeth. When the arrogant asshole couldn't get me pissed off one way, he always did the sexual innuendo thing. I smiled, satisfied. I chirped. My eyes flicked over to Weston's bruised temple. I added, my voice laced with mock-concern. I shrieked and pulled the door shut as he bolted from the bed, his eyes filled with fury. She's sweet and smart and has a shoulder for anyone to cry on. A big romantic and severely lacking in the guy department. He's smart, sexy, and can charm any girl with a pulse. Any girl except Sam, that is. When they're made to work together for the school fundraiser, he'll make her see that there's a fine line between love and hate. She's got everything – money, looks, smarts, personality. But this year, her friends will find out that there's much more than meets the eye to Madison. Perhaps she doesn't have everything. Laid-back and laconic, Ian is one of Sam's closest friends, and she is one of the most precious people in his life. But when Ian makes a startling discovery, his friendship with Sam is put to the test. Also Sam's overprotective stepbrother. Scott's used to being shifted off to the side, to being second-string. He's used to temporary, not permanent. Then he starts having some intense not-so-platonic feelings for the one person he can't have. As they near closer and closer to graduation, hormones go into overdrive, friendships are tested, bonds are formed, and ties are severed. They will learn that family isn't just blood. It's much more than that. But ducks sound so much more interesting than trees. ). I'm just… quirky. Quirky and eccentric. Samantha Spade. Yeah, I know. . . One of the many students at Maple Ridge Academy. What is Maple Ridge, you ask? Well, as the student body so lovingly refers to it as, Maple Ridge is the school for the rich and unwanted. See, time was, you used to have to have some kick-ass talent to get into MR. Now, you just have to have a shitload of money to be able to pay the extortionist-like tuition fees (seriously, I could live off one year's tuition for the rest of my natural-born days).

There have been a couple of girls who tried to befriend me, just to get a date with Scott or Ian, but that was back in tenth grade, when I was young and naïve. Thank goodness I know better, now. I detest him. I loathe him. I despise him about as much as I love Buffy. That is how much I do not like him. But alas, I'm constantly forced to see him, since he's been Maddy's friend since they were in diapers, and he's pretty cool with Alan, too. He and Scott are like brothers though, which irks me to no end. How my brother can be so close with the Son of the Devil is beyond me. The time he came 'round when Leah was visiting, even she liked him. I'd never been hit on before, so naturally, it was a little shocking. And, I'm not afraid to admit this (because all it means, really, is that I have eyes), but David was – is – handsome. I would even go as far as to say he's a hottie. Of course, I'd have to be drunk to say that in mixed company, but you get what I mean. See, unlike the public schools in Toronto, which are pleasantly diverse, you could count the amount of non-Caucasian people with both hands. Besides myself, my brother, and David, there's I think one or two more Guyanese people. I'd rather be off-topic, though, if I'm going to have to describe David Weston's physical features. Okay, we've got thick black hair that always looks tousled, though I guess on him, it works. He's got nice eyes, too, I suppose. They're a deep shade of brown, almost black, and sometimes you can see flecks of golden brown. I see it a lot when we argue, so I guess it's when he's pissed that his eyes go like that. He's got a strong jaw, and he's built, but not overly so. He's, well, I guess you could say he's got the body of a track star and a football star combined. That may be because he is both a track star and a football star. He's pretty cute, I guess… if you go for that whole tall, dark, and handsome thing. And now back to why we don't get along. After he (rather crudely) hit on me, I (rather loudly) told him off. Then he insulted me, so I insulted him back (I may be quiet a lot of the time, but like I said, when I get mad, I give as good as I get). Thus began our three-year-long feud. Scott, Alan, and I usually make the three-hour-long drive up north as soon as we can, because we really don't like being at home with the parents and Mandy. But this year, we all went on a vacation to the Big Apple to spend some 'quality time' together, seeing as we apparently never do that anymore. So, the first day back at Maple. Madison, who had arrived the day before me, had already finished settling in, and was lying on her stomach on her plush queen-sized bed, leafing through the latest issue of Teen People that I'd gotten the other day. Yes, we may be the unwanted, but we're highly compensated for it. There's only one person that we know who comes to the window when he visits us. Keeping silent, I moved out from the closet, and began to pack away my books. I have a whole trunk of them. Books, that is. At the end of every year, I have to empty my shelves, and then I have to repack them in September. I'm one of the few students who actually use their bookshelves for books. In fact, I have so many books, that Maddy graciously gave me her shelf space. It usually takes me a couple of hours to pack everything back, if I have help. Usually, I do. I could just imagine Weston's face. I'm not the sadist of the two of us. Well, whenever one goes on vacation, the other one tags along. This year, I guess I kind of broke their tradition. I guess I do that a lot. Not that I particularly like Weston to think that I'm trying to steal his best friend away. Not that I even care what he thinks. It's just, I know how hard it is when it feels like your friends are abandoning you. At five-foot-seven, I was used to being tall. Up until the end of tenth grade, that is. I don't usually swear, but he always finds it so funny when I do. I clenched my teeth. When the arrogant asshole couldn't get me pissed off one way, he always did the sexual innuendo thing. I smiled, satisfied. I chirped. My eyes flicked over to Weston's bruised temple. I added, my voice laced with mock-concern. I shrieked and pulled the door shut as he bolted from the bed, his eyes filled with fury. She's sweet and smart and has a shoulder for anyone to cry on. A big romantic and severely lacking in the guy department. He's smart, sexy, and can charm any girl with a pulse. Any girl except Sam, that is. When they're made to work together for the school fundraiser, he'll make her see that there's a fine line between love and hate. She's got everything – money, looks, smarts, personality. But this year, her friends will find out that there's much more than meets the eye to Madison. Perhaps she doesn't have everything. Laid-back and laconic, Ian is one of Sam's closest friends, and she is one of the most precious people in his life. But when Ian makes a startling discovery, his friendship with Sam is put to the test. Also Sam's overprotective stepbrother. Scott's used to being shifted off to the side, to being second-string. He's used to temporary, not permanent. Then he starts having some intense not-so-platonic feelings for the one person he can't have. As they near closer and closer to graduation, hormones go into overdrive, friendships are tested, bonds are formed, and ties are severed. They will learn that family isn't just blood. It's much more than that. But ducks sound so much more interesting than trees. ). I'm just… quirky. Quirky and eccentric. Samantha Spade. Yeah, I know. . . One of the many students at Maple Ridge Academy. What is Maple Ridge, you ask? Well, as the student body so lovingly refers to it as, Maple Ridge is the school for the rich and unwanted. See, time was, you used to have to have some kick-ass talent to get into MR. Now, you just have to have a shitload of money to be able to pay the extortionist-like tuition fees (seriously, I could live off one year's tuition for the rest of my natural-born days). No longer is it a school for the exceptionally gifted and talented. Madison, well, what can I say about her? She's perfection personified, in my opinion. She's incredibly kind, she's incredibly intelligent, she's incredibly beautiful in the classic sense (think killer long legs, beautiful sky blue eyes, bright blonde hair, and impeccably flawless skin – she's been named one of the top five most gorgeous people on campus three years in a row already), and she's the Student Council President, co-captain of the cheerleading team, and a proud member of the Science Club. He's our resident basketball star. In fact, basketball's how he got to come to MR. See, unlike ninety-two-percent of the school population, Ian came on a scholarship. His dad passed away when he was eight, and his mother had to work two jobs to support him and his younger brother. He was able to get a full scholarship to Maple Ridge, and of course, he took it. He's, what, six-foot-five? Yeah, he's mad tall. He's got thick, wavy hair that's the most interesting shade of brown. It's so cool; if the light hits it just right, you can see strands of gold. His eyes are the most captivating shade of blue; Madison once said the exact shade was cerulean. And when he gets excited or something, you can see little slivers of navy or light blue. He has, by far, the nicest eyes I've ever seen. See, for as long as I could remember, it was Alan, Amanda, I, and Mom. We weren't exactly poor, but Mom had to work her ass off like, twenty-four-seven. It didn't help that Amanda is about the most materialistic and shallow person to ever grace this earth. When Mom got engaged to Adam, I have to admit, even I got sucked in by the whole luxury lifestyle. She's milking it for all it's worth. And Adam seems to genuinely enjoy spoiling her; I guess she's the little princess he never had. Mom and Adam got married the May that I was in the eighth grade, so by the end of the summer, they figured it would be less hassle (on them) if they just sent me to MR for my high school years, like Adam did with Scott. But physical similarities aside, we're both highly opinionated (we have many a debate together), passionate about the things we love, have bad tempers (it takes a lot to really piss me off, but when I get mad…), and love chocolate chip ice cream. Scott used to detest me (he met Amanda first, and pretty much assumed I was as bitchy as my younger sister), and I wasn't exactly fond of him, either. Trust me, you wouldn't exactly be best friends with a guy whose boxers and other unmentionables you found all over your living room one Saturday morning. But then when we discovered the other liked BtVS as much as we each did, Tuesday night at eight became our time, and we gradually shed our judgments and stereotypes of one another. Oh, right. Sorry, got a little sidetracked. I do that often. So I got sent off to Maple at the beginning of ninth grade, and I pretty much lost contact with all of my friends, except for my lifelong best, Leah Green. You would think she'd be upset that her twin and older sister (who practically raised her, while Mom was at work) got booted off to boarding school. Alan's still got another three years after this, and I know it'll be weird for him without me around. I'll miss him, too. I'm glad he's managed to make genuine friends, though, like I have.

Keeping silent, I moved out from the closet, and began to pack away my books. I have a whole trunk of them. Books, that is. At the end of every year, I have to empty my shelves, and then I have to repack them in September. I'm one of the few students who actually use their bookshelves for books. In fact, I have so many books, that Maddy graciously gave me her shelf space. It usually takes me a couple of hours to pack everything back, if I have help. Usually, I do. I could just imagine Weston's face. I'm not the sadist of the two of us. Well, whenever one goes on vacation, the other one tags along. This year, I guess I kind of broke their tradition. I guess I do that a lot. Not that I particularly like Weston to think that I'm trying to steal his best friend away. Not that I even care what he thinks. It's just, I know how hard it is when it feels like your friends are abandoning you. At five-foot-seven, I was used to being tall. Up until the end of tenth grade, that is. I don't usually swear, but he always finds it so funny when I do. I clenched my teeth. When the arrogant asshole couldn't get me pissed off one way, he always did the sexual innuendo thing. I smiled, satisfied. I chirped. My eyes flicked over to Weston's bruised temple. I added, my voice laced with mock-concern. I shrieked and pulled the door shut as he bolted from the bed, his eyes filled with fury. She's sweet and smart and has a shoulder for anyone to cry on. A big romantic and severely lacking in the guy department. He's smart, sexy, and can charm any girl with a pulse. Any girl except Sam, that is. When they're made to work together for the school fundraiser, he'll make her see that there's a fine line between love and hate. She's got everything – money, looks, smarts, personality. But this year, her friends will find out that there's much more than meets the eye to Madison. Perhaps she doesn't have everything. Laid-back and laconic, Ian is one of Sam's closest friends, and she is one of the most precious people in his life. But when Ian makes a startling discovery, his friendship with Sam is put to the test. Also Sam's overprotective stepbrother. Scott's used to being shifted off to the side, to being second-string. He's used to temporary, not permanent. Then he starts having some intense not-so-platonic feelings for the one person he can't have. As they near closer and closer to graduation, hormones go into overdrive, friendships are tested, bonds are formed, and ties are severed. They will learn that family isn't just blood. It's much more than that. But ducks sound so much more interesting than trees. ). I'm just… quirky. Quirky and eccentric. Samantha Spade. Yeah, I know. . . One of the many students at Maple Ridge Academy. What is Maple Ridge, you ask? Well, as the student body so lovingly refers to it as, Maple Ridge is the school for the rich and unwanted. See, time was, you used to have to have some kick-ass talent to get into MR. Now, you just have to have a shitload of money to be able to pay the extortionist-like tuition fees (seriously, I could live off one year's tuition for the rest of my natural-born days). No longer is it a school for the exceptionally gifted and talented. Madison, well, what can I say about her? She's perfection personified, in my opinion. She's incredibly kind, she's incredibly intelligent, she's incredibly beautiful in the classic sense (think killer long legs, beautiful sky blue eyes, bright blonde hair, and impeccably flawless skin – she's been named one of the top five most gorgeous people on campus three years in a row already), and she's the Student Council President, co-captain of the cheerleading team, and a proud member of the Science Club. He's our resident basketball star. In fact, basketball's how he got to come to MR. See, unlike ninety-two-percent of the school population, Ian came on a scholarship. His dad passed away when he was eight, and his mother had to work two jobs to support him and his younger brother. He was able to get a full scholarship to Maple Ridge, and of course, he took it. He's, what, six-foot-five? Yeah, he's mad tall. He's got thick, wavy hair that's the most interesting shade of brown. It's so cool; if the light hits it just right, you can see strands of gold. His eyes are the most captivating shade of blue; Madison once said the exact shade was cerulean. And when he gets excited or something, you can see little slivers of navy or light blue. He has, by far, the nicest eyes I've ever seen. See, for as long as I could remember, it was Alan, Amanda, I, and Mom. We weren't exactly poor, but Mom had to work her ass off like, twenty-four-seven. It didn't help that Amanda is about the most materialistic and shallow person to ever grace this earth. When Mom got engaged to Adam, I have to admit, even I got sucked in by the whole luxury lifestyle. She's milking it for all it's worth. And Adam seems to genuinely enjoy spoiling her; I guess she's the little princess he never had. Mom and Adam got married the May that I was in the eighth grade, so by the end of the summer, they figured it would be less hassle (on them) if they just sent me to MR for my high school years, like Adam did with Scott. But physical similarities aside, we're both highly opinionated (we have many a debate together), passionate about the things we love, have bad tempers (it takes a lot to really piss me off, but when I get mad…), and love chocolate chip ice cream. Scott used to detest me (he met Amanda first, and pretty much assumed I was as bitchy as my younger sister), and I wasn't exactly fond of him, either. Trust me, you wouldn't exactly be best friends with a guy whose boxers and other unmentionables you found all over your living room one Saturday morning. But then when we discovered the other liked BtVS as much as we each did, Tuesday night at eight became our time, and we gradually shed our judgments and stereotypes of one another. Oh, right. Sorry, got a little sidetracked. I do that often. So I got sent off to Maple at the beginning of ninth grade, and I pretty much lost contact with all of my friends, except for my lifelong best, Leah Green. You would think she'd be upset that her twin and older sister (who practically raised her, while Mom was at work) got booted off to boarding school. Alan's still got another three years after this, and I know it'll be weird for him without me around. I'll miss him, too. I'm glad he's managed to make genuine friends, though, like I have. There have been a couple of girls who tried to befriend me, just to get a date with Scott or Ian, but that was back in tenth grade, when I was young and naïve. Thank goodness I know better, now. I detest him. I loathe him. I despise him about as much as I love Buffy. That is how much I do not like him. But alas, I'm constantly forced to see him, since he's been Maddy's friend since they were in diapers, and he's pretty cool with Alan, too. He and Scott are like brothers though, which irks me to no end. How my brother can be so close with the Son of the Devil is beyond me. The time he came 'round when Leah was visiting, even she liked him. I'd never been hit on before, so naturally, it was a little shocking. And, I'm not afraid to admit this (because all it means, really, is that I have eyes), but David was – is – handsome. I would even go as far as to say he's a hottie. Of course, I'd have to be drunk to say that in mixed company, but you get what I mean. See, unlike the public schools in Toronto, which are pleasantly diverse, you could count the amount of non-Caucasian people with both hands. Besides myself, my brother, and David, there's I think one or two more Guyanese people. I'd rather be off-topic, though, if I'm going to have to describe David Weston's physical features. Okay, we've got thick black hair that always looks tousled, though I guess on him, it works. He's got nice eyes, too, I suppose. They're a deep shade of brown, almost black, and sometimes you can see flecks of golden brown. I see it a lot when we argue, so I guess it's when he's pissed that his eyes go like that. He's got a strong jaw, and he's built, but not overly so. He's, well, I guess you could say he's got the body of a track star and a football star combined. That may be because he is both a track star and a football star. He's pretty cute, I guess… if you go for that whole tall, dark, and handsome thing. And now back to why we don't get along. After he (rather crudely) hit on me, I (rather loudly) told him off. Then he insulted me, so I insulted him back (I may be quiet a lot of the time, but like I said, when I get mad, I give as good as I get). Thus began our three-year-long feud. Scott, Alan, and I usually make the three-hour-long drive up north as soon as we can, because we really don't like being at home with the parents and Mandy. But this year, we all went on a vacation to the Big Apple to spend some 'quality time' together, seeing as we apparently never do that anymore. So, the first day back at Maple. Madison, who had arrived the day before me, had already finished settling in, and was lying on her stomach on her plush queen-sized bed, leafing through the latest issue of Teen People that I'd gotten the other day.

Now, you just have to have a shitload of money to be able to pay the extortionist-like tuition fees (seriously, I could live off one year's tuition for the rest of my natural-born days). No longer is it a school for the exceptionally gifted and talented. Madison, well, what can I say about her? She's perfection personified, in my opinion. She's incredibly kind, she's incredibly intelligent, she's incredibly beautiful in the classic sense (think killer long legs, beautiful sky blue eyes, bright blonde hair, and impeccably flawless skin – she's been named one of the top five most gorgeous people on campus three years in a row already), and she's the Student Council President, co-captain of the cheerleading team, and a proud member of the Science Club. He's our resident basketball star. In fact, basketball's how he got to come to MR. See, unlike ninety-two-percent of the school population, Ian came on a scholarship. His dad passed away when he was eight, and his mother had to work two jobs to support him and his younger brother. He was able to get a full scholarship to Maple Ridge, and of course, he took it. He's, what, six-foot-five? Yeah, he's mad tall. He's got thick, wavy hair that's the most interesting shade of brown. It's so cool; if the light hits it just right, you can see strands of gold. His eyes are the most captivating shade of blue; Madison once said the exact shade was cerulean. And when he gets excited or something, you can see little slivers of navy or light blue. He has, by far, the nicest eyes I've ever seen. See, for as long as I could remember, it was Alan, Amanda, I, and Mom. We weren't exactly poor, but Mom had to work her ass off like, twenty-four-seven. It didn't help that Amanda is about the most materialistic and shallow person to ever grace this earth. When Mom got engaged to Adam, I have to admit, even I got sucked in by the whole luxury lifestyle. She's milking it for all it's worth. And Adam seems to genuinely enjoy spoiling her; I guess she's the little princess he never had. Mom and Adam got married the May that I was in the eighth grade, so by the end of the summer, they figured it would be less hassle (on them) if they just sent me to MR for my high school years, like Adam did with Scott. But physical similarities aside, we're both highly opinionated (we have many a debate together), passionate about the things we love, have bad tempers (it takes a lot to really piss me off, but when I get mad…), and love chocolate chip ice cream. Scott used to detest me (he met Amanda first, and pretty much assumed I was as bitchy as my younger sister), and I wasn't exactly fond of him, either. Trust me, you wouldn't exactly be best friends with a guy whose boxers and other unmentionables you found all over your living room one Saturday morning. But then when we discovered the other liked BtVS as much as we each did, Tuesday night at eight became our time, and we gradually shed our judgments and stereotypes of one another. Oh, right. Sorry, got a little sidetracked. I do that often. So I got sent off to Maple at the beginning of ninth grade, and I pretty much lost contact with all of my friends, except for my lifelong best, Leah Green. You would think she'd be upset that her twin and older sister (who practically raised her, while Mom was at work) got booted off to boarding school. Alan's still got another three years after this, and I know it'll be weird for him without me around. I'll miss him, too. I'm glad he's managed to make genuine friends, though, like I have. There have been a couple of girls who tried to befriend me, just to get a date with Scott or Ian, but that was back in tenth grade, when I was young and naïve. Thank goodness I know better, now. I detest him. I loathe him. I despise him about as much as I love Buffy. That is how much I do not like him. But alas, I'm constantly forced to see him, since he's been Maddy's friend since they were in diapers, and he's pretty cool with Alan, too. He and Scott are like brothers though, which irks me to no end. How my brother can be so close with the Son of the Devil is beyond me. The time he came 'round when Leah was visiting, even she liked him. I'd never been hit on before, so naturally, it was a little shocking. And, I'm not afraid to admit this (because all it means, really, is that I have eyes), but David was – is – handsome. I would even go as far as to say he's a hottie. Of course, I'd have to be drunk to say that in mixed company, but you get what I mean. See, unlike the public schools in Toronto, which are pleasantly diverse, you could count the amount of non-Caucasian people with both hands. Besides myself, my brother, and David, there's I think one or two more Guyanese people. I'd rather be off-topic, though, if I'm going to have to describe David Weston's physical features. Okay, we've got thick black hair that always looks tousled, though I guess on him, it works. He's got nice eyes, too, I suppose. They're a deep shade of brown, almost black, and sometimes you can see flecks of golden brown. I see it a lot when we argue, so I guess it's when he's pissed that his eyes go like that. He's got a strong jaw, and he's built, but not overly so. He's, well, I guess you could say he's got the body of a track star and a football star combined. That may be because he is both a track star and a football star. He's pretty cute, I guess… if you go for that whole tall, dark, and handsome thing. And now back to why we don't get along. After he (rather crudely) hit on me, I (rather loudly) told him off. Then he insulted me, so I insulted him back (I may be quiet a lot of the time, but like I said, when I get mad, I give as good as I get). Thus began our three-year-long feud. Scott, Alan, and I usually make the three-hour-long drive up north as soon as we can, because we really don't like being at home with the parents and Mandy. But this year, we all went on a vacation to the Big Apple to spend some 'quality time' together, seeing as we apparently never do that anymore. So, the first day back at Maple. Madison, who had arrived the day before me, had already finished settling in, and was lying on her stomach on her plush queen-sized bed, leafing through the latest issue of Teen People that I'd gotten the other day. Yes, we may be the unwanted, but we're highly compensated for it. There's only one person that we know who comes to the window when he visits us. Keeping silent, I moved out from the closet, and began to pack away my books. I have a whole trunk of them. Books, that is. At the end of every year, I have to empty my shelves, and then I have to repack them in September. I'm one of the few students who actually use their bookshelves for books. In fact, I have so many books, that Maddy graciously gave me her shelf space. It usually takes me a couple of hours to pack everything back, if I have help. Usually, I do. I could just imagine Weston's face. I'm not the sadist of the two of us. Well, whenever one goes on vacation, the other one tags along. This year, I guess I kind of broke their tradition. I guess I do that a lot. Not that I particularly like Weston to think that I'm trying to steal his best friend away. Not that I even care what he thinks. It's just, I know how hard it is when it feels like your friends are abandoning you. At five-foot-seven, I was used to being tall. Up until the end of tenth grade, that is. I don't usually swear, but he always finds it so funny when I do. I clenched my teeth. When the arrogant asshole couldn't get me pissed off one way, he always did the sexual innuendo thing. I smiled, satisfied. I chirped. My eyes flicked over to Weston's bruised temple. I added, my voice laced with mock-concern. I shrieked and pulled the door shut as he bolted from the bed, his eyes filled with fury. She's sweet and smart and has a shoulder for anyone to cry on. A big romantic and severely lacking in the guy department. He's smart, sexy, and can charm any girl with a pulse. Any girl except Sam, that is. When they're made to work together for the school fundraiser, he'll make her see that there's a fine line between love and hate. She's got everything – money, looks, smarts, personality. But this year, her friends will find out that there's much more than meets the eye to Madison. Perhaps she doesn't have everything. Laid-back and laconic, Ian is one of Sam's closest friends, and she is one of the most precious people in his life. But when Ian makes a startling discovery, his friendship with Sam is put to the test. Also Sam's overprotective stepbrother. Scott's used to being shifted off to the side, to being second-string. He's used to temporary, not permanent. Then he starts having some intense not-so-platonic feelings for the one person he can't have. As they near closer and closer to graduation, hormones go into overdrive, friendships are tested, bonds are formed, and ties are severed. They will learn that family isn't just blood. It's much more than that. But ducks sound so much more interesting than trees. ). I'm just… quirky. Quirky and eccentric. Samantha Spade. Yeah, I know. . .

You would think she'd be upset that her twin and older sister (who practically raised her, while Mom was at work) got booted off to boarding school. Alan's still got another three years after this, and I know it'll be weird for him without me around. I'll miss him, too. I'm glad he's managed to make genuine friends, though, like I have. There have been a couple of girls who tried to befriend me, just to get a date with Scott or Ian, but that was back in tenth grade, when I was young and naïve. Thank goodness I know better, now. I detest him. I loathe him. I despise him about as much as I love Buffy. That is how much I do not like him. But alas, I'm constantly forced to see him, since he's been Maddy's friend since they were in diapers, and he's pretty cool with Alan, too. He and Scott are like brothers though, which irks me to no end. How my brother can be so close with the Son of the Devil is beyond me. The time he came 'round when Leah was visiting, even she liked him. I'd never been hit on before, so naturally, it was a little shocking. And, I'm not afraid to admit this (because all it means, really, is that I have eyes), but David was – is – handsome. I would even go as far as to say he's a hottie. Of course, I'd have to be drunk to say that in mixed company, but you get what I mean. See, unlike the public schools in Toronto, which are pleasantly diverse, you could count the amount of non-Caucasian people with both hands. Besides myself, my brother, and David, there's I think one or two more Guyanese people. I'd rather be off-topic, though, if I'm going to have to describe David Weston's physical features. Okay, we've got thick black hair that always looks tousled, though I guess on him, it works. He's got nice eyes, too, I suppose. They're a deep shade of brown, almost black, and sometimes you can see flecks of golden brown. I see it a lot when we argue, so I guess it's when he's pissed that his eyes go like that. He's got a strong jaw, and he's built, but not overly so. He's, well, I guess you could say he's got the body of a track star and a football star combined. That may be because he is both a track star and a football star. He's pretty cute, I guess… if you go for that whole tall, dark, and handsome thing. And now back to why we don't get along. After he (rather crudely) hit on me, I (rather loudly) told him off. Then he insulted me, so I insulted him back (I may be quiet a lot of the time, but like I said, when I get mad, I give as good as I get). Thus began our three-year-long feud. Scott, Alan, and I usually make the three-hour-long drive up north as soon as we can, because we really don't like being at home with the parents and Mandy. But this year, we all went on a vacation to the Big Apple to spend some 'quality time' together, seeing as we apparently never do that anymore. So, the first day back at Maple. Madison, who had arrived the day before me, had already finished settling in, and was lying on her stomach on her plush queen-sized bed, leafing through the latest issue of Teen People that I'd gotten the other day. Yes, we may be the unwanted, but we're highly compensated for it. There's only one person that we know who comes to the window when he visits us. Keeping silent, I moved out from the closet, and began to pack away my books. I have a whole trunk of them. Books, that is. At the end of every year, I have to empty my shelves, and then I have to repack them in September. I'm one of the few students who actually use their bookshelves for books. In fact, I have so many books, that Maddy graciously gave me her shelf space. It usually takes me a couple of hours to pack everything back, if I have help. Usually, I do. I could just imagine Weston's face. I'm not the sadist of the two of us. Well, whenever one goes on vacation, the other one tags along. This year, I guess I kind of broke their tradition. I guess I do that a lot. Not that I particularly like Weston to think that I'm trying to steal his best friend away. Not that I even care what he thinks. It's just, I know how hard it is when it feels like your friends are abandoning you. At five-foot-seven, I was used to being tall. Up until the end of tenth grade, that is. I don't usually swear, but he always finds it so funny when I do. I clenched my teeth. When the arrogant asshole couldn't get me pissed off one way, he always did the sexual innuendo thing. I smiled, satisfied. I chirped. My eyes flicked over to Weston's bruised temple. I added, my voice laced with mock-concern. I shrieked and pulled the door shut as he bolted from the bed, his eyes filled with fury. She's sweet and smart and has a shoulder for anyone to cry on. A big romantic and severely lacking in the guy department. He's smart, sexy, and can charm any girl with a pulse. Any girl except Sam, that is. When they're made to work together for the school fundraiser, he'll make her see that there's a fine line between love and hate. She's got everything – money, looks, smarts, personality. But this year, her friends will find out that there's much more than meets the eye to Madison. Perhaps she doesn't have everything. Laid-back and laconic, Ian is one of Sam's closest friends, and she is one of the most precious people in his life. But when Ian makes a startling discovery, his friendship with Sam is put to the test. Also Sam's overprotective stepbrother. Scott's used to being shifted off to the side, to being second-string. He's used to temporary, not permanent. Then he starts having some intense not-so-platonic feelings for the one person he can't have. As they near closer and closer to graduation, hormones go into overdrive, friendships are tested, bonds are formed, and ties are severed. They will learn that family isn't just blood. It's much more than that. But ducks sound so much more interesting than trees. ). I'm just… quirky. Quirky and eccentric. Samantha Spade. Yeah, I know. . . One of the many students at Maple Ridge Academy. What is Maple Ridge, you ask? Well, as the student body so lovingly refers to it as, Maple Ridge is the school for the rich and unwanted. See, time was, you used to have to have some kick-ass talent to get into MR. Now, you just have to have a shitload of money to be able to pay the extortionist-like tuition fees (seriously, I could live off one year's tuition for the rest of my natural-born days). No longer is it a school for the exceptionally gifted and talented. Madison, well, what can I say about her? She's perfection personified, in my opinion. She's incredibly kind, she's incredibly intelligent, she's incredibly beautiful in the classic sense (think killer long legs, beautiful sky blue eyes, bright blonde hair, and impeccably flawless skin – she's been named one of the top five most gorgeous people on campus three years in a row already), and she's the Student Council President, co-captain of the cheerleading team, and a proud member of the Science Club. He's our resident basketball star. In fact, basketball's how he got to come to MR. See, unlike ninety-two-percent of the school population, Ian came on a scholarship. His dad passed away when he was eight, and his mother had to work two jobs to support him and his younger brother. He was able to get a full scholarship to Maple Ridge, and of course, he took it. He's, what, six-foot-five? Yeah, he's mad tall. He's got thick, wavy hair that's the most interesting shade of brown. It's so cool; if the light hits it just right, you can see strands of gold. His eyes are the most captivating shade of blue; Madison once said the exact shade was cerulean. And when he gets excited or something, you can see little slivers of navy or light blue. He has, by far, the nicest eyes I've ever seen. See, for as long as I could remember, it was Alan, Amanda, I, and Mom. We weren't exactly poor, but Mom had to work her ass off like, twenty-four-seven. It didn't help that Amanda is about the most materialistic and shallow person to ever grace this earth. When Mom got engaged to Adam, I have to admit, even I got sucked in by the whole luxury lifestyle. She's milking it for all it's worth. And Adam seems to genuinely enjoy spoiling her; I guess she's the little princess he never had. Mom and Adam got married the May that I was in the eighth grade, so by the end of the summer, they figured it would be less hassle (on them) if they just sent me to MR for my high school years, like Adam did with Scott. But physical similarities aside, we're both highly opinionated (we have many a debate together), passionate about the things we love, have bad tempers (it takes a lot to really piss me off, but when I get mad…), and love chocolate chip ice cream. Scott used to detest me (he met Amanda first, and pretty much assumed I was as bitchy as my younger sister), and I wasn't exactly fond of him, either. Trust me, you wouldn't exactly be best friends with a guy whose boxers and other unmentionables you found all over your living room one Saturday morning. But then when we discovered the other liked BtVS as much as we each did, Tuesday night at eight became our time, and we gradually shed our judgments and stereotypes of one another. Oh, right. Sorry, got a little sidetracked. I do that often. So I got sent off to Maple at the beginning of ninth grade, and I pretty much lost contact with all of my friends, except for my lifelong best, Leah Green. You would think she'd be upset that her twin and older sister (who practically raised her, while Mom was at work) got booted off to boarding school.

His eyes squinted behind the wire rimmed glasses as he glanced over the documents spread out before him. Sam Westlane kept his eyes cast down. The boy's shiny red hair was cut short and messily, ragged at the ends. His clothes were baggy and oversized, engulfing his small frame. He was clearly extremely shy and nervous, chewing his lip every two seconds. He sympathized with the boy. Finnigan was suddenly determined to help young Westlane out. Nodding briskly, he said, At least, what I believe should be a Crestan student . . Finnigan took a while to answer because he was momentarily stunned by the boy's beautiful, emerald green eyes and his pale, porcelain skin. The boy looked almost . . . feminine. Finnigan shook his head to clear his thoughts and frowned. Poor kid. Something tells me hes not just going to be bullied by the others for his financial status alone. Theyre going to drive him away by the end of the week, just like the last kid who came here on scholarship. What a shame. He seems like such a nice boy, too. Sam Westlane breathed a silent prayer.

She really, really hoped her roommate was nice and not too attentive to details. Heaving another breath, she turned the doorknob. It was unlocked. His dark black hair was still damp from the shower and his clear gray eyes pierced into hers. Her gaze moved down to his bare, tanned chest and she felt her cheeks burning.

Stupid, stupid, stu -  She fell backward when the door abruptly opened. Stumbling, she crashed against something solidly warm and she heard a soft grunt. I'm an idiot. Vincent raised his eyebrow as he leaned against the doorframe. The tiny boy continued whispering his apologies, nearly bowing by the time he was finished. Vincent frowned as he studied his new roommate. This one's a nervous wreck. Should be easy enough to get rid of. Not like that nagging know-it-all who was here last time. This kid will be out of here by the end of the week. He sighed. Between them, it was their favorite game to either recruit the newbies onto their sides or kick them out. What was that about? So much for getting a nice roommate. She blew a wisp of her bangs out of her eyes in defeat and turned around. The room was neat, at least. Her roommate was surprisingly well organized for a boy.

Stupid, stupid, stu -  She fell backward when the door abruptly opened. Stumbling, she crashed against something solidly warm and she heard a soft grunt. I'm an idiot. Vincent raised his eyebrow as he leaned against the doorframe. The tiny boy continued whispering his apologies, nearly bowing by the time he was finished. Vincent frowned as he studied his new roommate. This one's a nervous wreck. Should be easy enough to get rid of. Not like that nagging know-it-all who was here last time. This kid will be out of here by the end of the week. He sighed. Between them, it was their favorite game to either recruit the newbies onto their sides or kick them out. What was that about? So much for getting a nice roommate. She blew a wisp of her bangs out of her eyes in defeat and turned around. The room was neat, at least. Her roommate was surprisingly well organized for a boy. Huh. Then again, I don't have much to compare to. Dad, Terry, Uncle Frank . . . Her teeth clenched and once again, she turned her attention back to the room. Pressing her lips together, she straggled slowly over to her side of the room and began to put away her sparse possessions. Vincent strolled across the lawn, tucking his hands into his pockets. Vincent smiled, amused. They continued their way across the meticulously kept green field, the smell of freshly mown grass pungent in the air. He shrugged. As the principal of the private all boys school for the last thirty years, he had grown more and more determined to uphold the school's traditions and maintain its . He nodded at the boy. His eyes squinted behind the wire rimmed glasses as he glanced over the documents spread out before him. Sam Westlane kept his eyes cast down. The boy's shiny red hair was cut short and messily, ragged at the ends. His clothes were baggy and oversized, engulfing his small frame. He was clearly extremely shy and nervous, chewing his lip every two seconds. He sympathized with the boy. Finnigan was suddenly determined to help young Westlane out. Nodding briskly, he said, At least, what I believe should be a Crestan student . . Finnigan took a while to answer because he was momentarily stunned by the boy's beautiful, emerald green eyes and his pale, porcelain skin. The boy looked almost . . . feminine. Finnigan shook his head to clear his thoughts and frowned. Poor kid. Something tells me hes not just going to be bullied by the others for his financial status alone. Theyre going to drive him away by the end of the week, just like the last kid who came here on scholarship. What a shame. He seems like such a nice boy, too. Sam Westlane breathed a silent prayer. The ordeal was over. The school had accepted him. Headmaster Finnigan seemed like a nice, friendly man and she had felt a bit guilty for lying to him . . . but it was necessary. Her future depended on this step. Her fingers tightened instinctively as the memories she'd tried so hard to lock away resurfaced with a vengeance. Her parents' deaths in the car accident …her energetic brother now stuck in a coma like a living vegetable . . . her uncle taking her in . . . her uncle's vile treatmentof her for two years . . She'd finally run away after finding out that her desperate application to Crestan had been accepted. For days, she'd prayed that her uncle wouldn't find out and lock her away in the attic again, but luck was on her side. Her hands tightened on her bag, knuckles whitening. It was time that her life took a turn for the better. She changed her mind. Her bad luck was still running strong and fast. After getting her schedule and supplies, she found her dorm room. She really, really hoped her roommate was nice and not too attentive to details. Heaving another breath, she turned the doorknob. It was unlocked. His dark black hair was still damp from the shower and his clear gray eyes pierced into hers. Her gaze moved down to his bare, tanned chest and she felt her cheeks burning.

Finnigan took a while to answer because he was momentarily stunned by the boy's beautiful, emerald green eyes and his pale, porcelain skin. The boy looked almost . . . feminine. Finnigan shook his head to clear his thoughts and frowned. Poor kid. Something tells me hes not just going to be bullied by the others for his financial status alone. Theyre going to drive him away by the end of the week, just like the last kid who came here on scholarship. What a shame. He seems like such a nice boy, too. Sam Westlane breathed a silent prayer. The ordeal was over. The school had accepted him. Headmaster Finnigan seemed like a nice, friendly man and she had felt a bit guilty for lying to him . . . but it was necessary. Her future depended on this step. Her fingers tightened instinctively as the memories she'd tried so hard to lock away resurfaced with a vengeance. Her parents' deaths in the car accident …her energetic brother now stuck in a coma like a living vegetable . . . her uncle taking her in . . . her uncle's vile treatmentof her for two years . . She'd finally run away after finding out that her desperate application to Crestan had been accepted. For days, she'd prayed that her uncle wouldn't find out and lock her away in the attic again, but luck was on her side. Her hands tightened on her bag, knuckles whitening. It was time that her life took a turn for the better. She changed her mind. Her bad luck was still running strong and fast. After getting her schedule and supplies, she found her dorm room. She really, really hoped her roommate was nice and not too attentive to details. Heaving another breath, she turned the doorknob. It was unlocked. His dark black hair was still damp from the shower and his clear gray eyes pierced into hers. Her gaze moved down to his bare, tanned chest and she felt her cheeks burning. He was evidently in the middle of changing. Thank god he had on a pair of blue jeans already. Stupid, stupid, stupid! Why didn't you knock? Stupid, stupid, stu -  She fell backward when the door abruptly opened. Stumbling, she crashed against something solidly warm and she heard a soft grunt. I'm an idiot. Vincent raised his eyebrow as he leaned against the doorframe. The tiny boy continued whispering his apologies, nearly bowing by the time he was finished. Vincent frowned as he studied his new roommate. This one's a nervous wreck. Should be easy enough to get rid of. Not like that nagging know-it-all who was here last time. This kid will be out of here by the end of the week. He sighed. Between them, it was their favorite game to either recruit the newbies onto their sides or kick them out. What was that about? So much for getting a nice roommate. She blew a wisp of her bangs out of her eyes in defeat and turned around. The room was neat, at least. Her roommate was surprisingly well organized for a boy. Huh. Then again, I don't have much to compare to. Dad, Terry, Uncle Frank . . . Her teeth clenched and once again, she turned her attention back to the room. Pressing her lips together, she straggled slowly over to her side of the room and began to put away her sparse possessions. Vincent strolled across the lawn, tucking his hands into his pockets. Vincent smiled, amused. They continued their way across the meticulously kept green field, the smell of freshly mown grass pungent in the air. He shrugged. As the principal of the private all boys school for the last thirty years, he had grown more and more determined to uphold the school's traditions and maintain its . He nodded at the boy. His eyes squinted behind the wire rimmed glasses as he glanced over the documents spread out before him. Sam Westlane kept his eyes cast down. The boy's shiny red hair was cut short and messily, ragged at the ends. His clothes were baggy and oversized, engulfing his small frame.

Vincent raised his eyebrow as he leaned against the doorframe. The tiny boy continued whispering his apologies, nearly bowing by the time he was finished. Vincent frowned as he studied his new roommate. This one's a nervous wreck. Should be easy enough to get rid of. Not like that nagging know-it-all who was here last time. This kid will be out of here by the end of the week. He sighed. Between them, it was their favorite game to either recruit the newbies onto their sides or kick them out. What was that about? So much for getting a nice roommate. She blew a wisp of her bangs out of her eyes in defeat and turned around. The room was neat, at least. Her roommate was surprisingly well organized for a boy. Huh. Then again, I don't have much to compare to. Dad, Terry, Uncle Frank . . . Her teeth clenched and once again, she turned her attention back to the room. Pressing her lips together, she straggled slowly over to her side of the room and began to put away her sparse possessions. Vincent strolled across the lawn, tucking his hands into his pockets.

His eyes squinted behind the wire rimmed glasses as he glanced over the documents spread out before him. Sam Westlane kept his eyes cast down. The boy's shiny red hair was cut short and messily, ragged at the ends. His clothes were baggy and oversized, engulfing his small frame. He was clearly extremely shy and nervous, chewing his lip every two seconds. He sympathized with the boy. Finnigan was suddenly determined to help young Westlane out. Nodding briskly, he said, At least, what I believe should be a Crestan student . . Finnigan took a while to answer because he was momentarily stunned by the boy's beautiful, emerald green eyes and his pale, porcelain skin. The boy looked almost . . . feminine. Finnigan shook his head to clear his thoughts and frowned. Poor kid. Something tells me hes not just going to be bullied by the others for his financial status alone. Theyre going to drive him away by the end of the week, just like the last kid who came here on scholarship. What a shame. He seems like such a nice boy, too. Sam Westlane breathed a silent prayer. The ordeal was over. The school had accepted him. Headmaster Finnigan seemed like a nice, friendly man and she had felt a bit guilty for lying to him . . . but it was necessary. Her future depended on this step. Her fingers tightened instinctively as the memories she'd tried so hard to lock away resurfaced with a vengeance. Her parents' deaths in the car accident …her energetic brother now stuck in a coma like a living vegetable . . . her uncle taking her in . . . her uncle's vile treatmentof her for two years . . She'd finally run away after finding out that her desperate application to Crestan had been accepted. For days, she'd prayed that her uncle wouldn't find out and lock her away in the attic again, but luck was on her side. Her hands tightened on her bag, knuckles whitening. It was time that her life took a turn for the better. She changed her mind. Her bad luck was still running strong and fast. After getting her schedule and supplies, she found her dorm room. She really, really hoped her roommate was nice and not too attentive to details. Heaving another breath, she turned the doorknob. It was unlocked. His dark black hair was still damp from the shower and his clear gray eyes pierced into hers. Her gaze moved down to his bare, tanned chest and she felt her cheeks burning.

She's sweet and smart and has a shoulder for anyone to cry on. A big romantic and severely lacking in the guy department. He's smart, sexy, and can charm any girl with a pulse. Any girl except Sam, that is. When they're made to work together for the school fundraiser, he'll make her see that there's a fine line between love and hate. She's got everything – money, looks, smarts, personality. But this year, her friends will find out that there's much more than meets the eye to Madison. Perhaps she doesn't have everything. Laid-back and laconic, Ian is one of Sam's closest friends, and she is one of the most precious people in his life. But when Ian makes a startling discovery, his friendship with Sam is put to the test. Also Sam's overprotective stepbrother. Scott's used to being shifted off to the side, to being second-string. He's used to temporary, not permanent. Then he starts having some intense not-so-platonic feelings for the one person he can't have. As they near closer and closer to graduation, hormones go into overdrive, friendships are tested, bonds are formed, and ties are severed. They will learn that family isn't just blood. It's much more than that. But ducks sound so much more interesting than trees. ). I'm just… quirky. Quirky and eccentric. Samantha Spade. Yeah, I know. . . One of the many students at Maple Ridge Academy. What is Maple Ridge, you ask? Well, as the student body so lovingly refers to it as, Maple Ridge is the school for the rich and unwanted. See, time was, you used to have to have some kick-ass talent to get into MR. Now, you just have to have a shitload of money to be able to pay the extortionist-like tuition fees (seriously, I could live off one year's tuition for the rest of my natural-born days). No longer is it a school for the exceptionally gifted and talented. Madison, well, what can I say about her? She's perfection personified, in my opinion. She's incredibly kind, she's incredibly intelligent, she's incredibly beautiful in the classic sense (think killer long legs, beautiful sky blue eyes, bright blonde hair, and impeccably flawless skin – she's been named one of the top five most gorgeous people on campus three years in a row already), and she's the Student Council President, co-captain of the cheerleading team, and a proud member of the Science Club. He's our resident basketball star. In fact, basketball's how he got to come to MR. See, unlike ninety-two-percent of the school population, Ian came on a scholarship. His dad passed away when he was eight, and his mother had to work two jobs to support him and his younger brother. He was able to get a full scholarship to Maple Ridge, and of course, he took it. He's, what, six-foot-five? Yeah, he's mad tall. He's got thick, wavy hair that's the most interesting shade of brown. It's so cool; if the light hits it just right, you can see strands of gold. His eyes are the most captivating shade of blue; Madison once said the exact shade was cerulean. And when he gets excited or something, you can see little slivers of navy or light blue. He has, by far, the nicest eyes I've ever seen. See, for as long as I could remember, it was Alan, Amanda, I, and Mom. We weren't exactly poor, but Mom had to work her ass off like, twenty-four-seven. It didn't help that Amanda is about the most materialistic and shallow person to ever grace this earth. When Mom got engaged to Adam, I have to admit, even I got sucked in by the whole luxury lifestyle. She's milking it for all it's worth. And Adam seems to genuinely enjoy spoiling her; I guess she's the little princess he never had. Mom and Adam got married the May that I was in the eighth grade, so by the end of the summer, they figured it would be less hassle (on them) if they just sent me to MR for my high school years, like Adam did with Scott. But physical similarities aside, we're both highly opinionated (we have many a debate together), passionate about the things we love, have bad tempers (it takes a lot to really piss me off, but when I get mad…), and love chocolate chip ice cream. Scott used to detest me (he met Amanda first, and pretty much assumed I was as bitchy as my younger sister), and I wasn't exactly fond of him, either. Trust me, you wouldn't exactly be best friends with a guy whose boxers and other unmentionables you found all over your living room one Saturday morning. But then when we discovered the other liked BtVS as much as we each did, Tuesday night at eight became our time, and we gradually shed our judgments and stereotypes of one another. Oh, right. Sorry, got a little sidetracked. I do that often. So I got sent off to Maple at the beginning of ninth grade, and I pretty much lost contact with all of my friends, except for my lifelong best, Leah Green. You would think she'd be upset that her twin and older sister (who practically raised her, while Mom was at work) got booted off to boarding school. Alan's still got another three years after this, and I know it'll be weird for him without me around. I'll miss him, too. I'm glad he's managed to make genuine friends, though, like I have. There have been a couple of girls who tried to befriend me, just to get a date with Scott or Ian, but that was back in tenth grade, when I was young and naïve. Thank goodness I know better, now. I detest him. I loathe him. I despise him about as much as I love Buffy. That is how much I do not like him. But alas, I'm constantly forced to see him, since he's been Maddy's friend since they were in diapers, and he's pretty cool with Alan, too. He and Scott are like brothers though, which irks me to no end. How my brother can be so close with the Son of the Devil is beyond me. The time he came 'round when Leah was visiting, even she liked him. I'd never been hit on before, so naturally, it was a little shocking. And, I'm not afraid to admit this (because all it means, really, is that I have eyes), but David was – is – handsome. I would even go as far as to say he's a hottie. Of course, I'd have to be drunk to say that in mixed company, but you get what I mean. See, unlike the public schools in Toronto, which are pleasantly diverse, you could count the amount of non-Caucasian people with both hands. Besides myself, my brother, and David, there's I think one or two more Guyanese people. I'd rather be off-topic, though, if I'm going to have to describe David Weston's physical features. Okay, we've got thick black hair that always looks tousled, though I guess on him, it works. He's got nice eyes, too, I suppose. They're a deep shade of brown, almost black, and sometimes you can see flecks of golden brown. I see it a lot when we argue, so I guess it's when he's pissed that his eyes go like that. He's got a strong jaw, and he's built, but not overly so. He's, well, I guess you could say he's got the body of a track star and a football star combined. That may be because he is both a track star and a football star. He's pretty cute, I guess… if you go for that whole tall, dark, and handsome thing. And now back to why we don't get along. After he (rather crudely) hit on me, I (rather loudly) told him off. Then he insulted me, so I insulted him back (I may be quiet a lot of the time, but like I said, when I get mad, I give as good as I get). Thus began our three-year-long feud. Scott, Alan, and I usually make the three-hour-long drive up north as soon as we can, because we really don't like being at home with the parents and Mandy. But this year, we all went on a vacation to the Big Apple to spend some 'quality time' together, seeing as we apparently never do that anymore. So, the first day back at Maple. Madison, who had arrived the day before me, had already finished settling in, and was lying on her stomach on her plush queen-sized bed, leafing through the latest issue of Teen People that I'd gotten the other day. Yes, we may be the unwanted, but we're highly compensated for it. There's only one person that we know who comes to the window when he visits us. Keeping silent, I moved out from the closet, and began to pack away my books. I have a whole trunk of them. Books, that is. At the end of every year, I have to empty my shelves, and then I have to repack them in September. I'm one of the few students who actually use their bookshelves for books. In fact, I have so many books, that Maddy graciously gave me her shelf space. It usually takes me a couple of hours to pack everything back, if I have help. Usually, I do. I could just imagine Weston's face. I'm not the sadist of the two of us. Well, whenever one goes on vacation, the other one tags along. This year, I guess I kind of broke their tradition. I guess I do that a lot. Not that I particularly like Weston to think that I'm trying to steal his best friend away. Not that I even care what he thinks. It's just, I know how hard it is when it feels like your friends are abandoning you. At five-foot-seven, I was used to being tall. Up until the end of tenth grade, that is. I don't usually swear, but he always finds it so funny when I do. I clenched my teeth. When the arrogant asshole couldn't get me pissed off one way, he always did the sexual innuendo thing. I smiled, satisfied. I chirped. My eyes flicked over to Weston's bruised temple. I added, my voice laced with mock-concern. I shrieked and pulled the door shut as he bolted from the bed, his eyes filled with fury. She's sweet and smart and has a shoulder for anyone to cry on. A big romantic and severely lacking in the guy department. He's smart, sexy, and can charm any girl with a pulse. Any girl except Sam, that is.

But this year, her friends will find out that there's much more than meets the eye to Madison. Perhaps she doesn't have everything. Laid-back and laconic, Ian is one of Sam's closest friends, and she is one of the most precious people in his life. But when Ian makes a startling discovery, his friendship with Sam is put to the test. Also Sam's overprotective stepbrother. Scott's used to being shifted off to the side, to being second-string. He's used to temporary, not permanent. Then he starts having some intense not-so-platonic feelings for the one person he can't have. As they near closer and closer to graduation, hormones go into overdrive, friendships are tested, bonds are formed, and ties are severed. They will learn that family isn't just blood. It's much more than that. But ducks sound so much more interesting than trees. ). I'm just… quirky. Quirky and eccentric. Samantha Spade. Yeah, I know. . . One of the many students at Maple Ridge Academy. What is Maple Ridge, you ask? Well, as the student body so lovingly refers to it as, Maple Ridge is the school for the rich and unwanted. See, time was, you used to have to have some kick-ass talent to get into MR. Now, you just have to have a shitload of money to be able to pay the extortionist-like tuition fees (seriously, I could live off one year's tuition for the rest of my natural-born days). No longer is it a school for the exceptionally gifted and talented. Madison, well, what can I say about her? She's perfection personified, in my opinion. She's incredibly kind, she's incredibly intelligent, she's incredibly beautiful in the classic sense (think killer long legs, beautiful sky blue eyes, bright blonde hair, and impeccably flawless skin – she's been named one of the top five most gorgeous people on campus three years in a row already), and she's the Student Council President, co-captain of the cheerleading team, and a proud member of the Science Club. He's our resident basketball star. In fact, basketball's how he got to come to MR. See, unlike ninety-two-percent of the school population, Ian came on a scholarship. His dad passed away when he was eight, and his mother had to work two jobs to support him and his younger brother. He was able to get a full scholarship to Maple Ridge, and of course, he took it. He's, what, six-foot-five? Yeah, he's mad tall. He's got thick, wavy hair that's the most interesting shade of brown. It's so cool; if the light hits it just right, you can see strands of gold. His eyes are the most captivating shade of blue; Madison once said the exact shade was cerulean. And when he gets excited or something, you can see little slivers of navy or light blue. He has, by far, the nicest eyes I've ever seen. See, for as long as I could remember, it was Alan, Amanda, I, and Mom. We weren't exactly poor, but Mom had to work her ass off like, twenty-four-seven. It didn't help that Amanda is about the most materialistic and shallow person to ever grace this earth. When Mom got engaged to Adam, I have to admit, even I got sucked in by the whole luxury lifestyle. She's milking it for all it's worth. And Adam seems to genuinely enjoy spoiling her; I guess she's the little princess he never had. Mom and Adam got married the May that I was in the eighth grade, so by the end of the summer, they figured it would be less hassle (on them) if they just sent me to MR for my high school years, like Adam did with Scott. But physical similarities aside, we're both highly opinionated (we have many a debate together), passionate about the things we love, have bad tempers (it takes a lot to really piss me off, but when I get mad…), and love chocolate chip ice cream. Scott used to detest me (he met Amanda first, and pretty much assumed I was as bitchy as my younger sister), and I wasn't exactly fond of him, either. Trust me, you wouldn't exactly be best friends with a guy whose boxers and other unmentionables you found all over your living room one Saturday morning. But then when we discovered the other liked BtVS as much as we each did, Tuesday night at eight became our time, and we gradually shed our judgments and stereotypes of one another. Oh, right. Sorry, got a little sidetracked. I do that often. So I got sent off to Maple at the beginning of ninth grade, and I pretty much lost contact with all of my friends, except for my lifelong best, Leah Green. You would think she'd be upset that her twin and older sister (who practically raised her, while Mom was at work) got booted off to boarding school. Alan's still got another three years after this, and I know it'll be weird for him without me around. I'll miss him, too. I'm glad he's managed to make genuine friends, though, like I have. There have been a couple of girls who tried to befriend me, just to get a date with Scott or Ian, but that was back in tenth grade, when I was young and naïve. Thank goodness I know better, now. I detest him. I loathe him. I despise him about as much as I love Buffy. That is how much I do not like him. But alas, I'm constantly forced to see him, since he's been Maddy's friend since they were in diapers, and he's pretty cool with Alan, too. He and Scott are like brothers though, which irks me to no end. How my brother can be so close with the Son of the Devil is beyond me. The time he came 'round when Leah was visiting, even she liked him. I'd never been hit on before, so naturally, it was a little shocking. And, I'm not afraid to admit this (because all it means, really, is that I have eyes), but David was – is – handsome. I would even go as far as to say he's a hottie. Of course, I'd have to be drunk to say that in mixed company, but you get what I mean. See, unlike the public schools in Toronto, which are pleasantly diverse, you could count the amount of non-Caucasian people with both hands. Besides myself, my brother, and David, there's I think one or two more Guyanese people. I'd rather be off-topic, though, if I'm going to have to describe David Weston's physical features. Okay, we've got thick black hair that always looks tousled, though I guess on him, it works. He's got nice eyes, too, I suppose. They're a deep shade of brown, almost black, and sometimes you can see flecks of golden brown. I see it a lot when we argue, so I guess it's when he's pissed that his eyes go like that. He's got a strong jaw, and he's built, but not overly so. He's, well, I guess you could say he's got the body of a track star and a football star combined. That may be because he is both a track star and a football star. He's pretty cute, I guess… if you go for that whole tall, dark, and handsome thing. And now back to why we don't get along. After he (rather crudely) hit on me, I (rather loudly) told him off. Then he insulted me, so I insulted him back (I may be quiet a lot of the time, but like I said, when I get mad, I give as good as I get). Thus began our three-year-long feud. Scott, Alan, and I usually make the three-hour-long drive up north as soon as we can, because we really don't like being at home with the parents and Mandy. But this year, we all went on a vacation to the Big Apple to spend some 'quality time' together, seeing as we apparently never do that anymore. So, the first day back at Maple. Madison, who had arrived the day before me, had already finished settling in, and was lying on her stomach on her plush queen-sized bed, leafing through the latest issue of Teen People that I'd gotten the other day. Yes, we may be the unwanted, but we're highly compensated for it. There's only one person that we know who comes to the window when he visits us. Keeping silent, I moved out from the closet, and began to pack away my books. I have a whole trunk of them. Books, that is. At the end of every year, I have to empty my shelves, and then I have to repack them in September. I'm one of the few students who actually use their bookshelves for books. In fact, I have so many books, that Maddy graciously gave me her shelf space. It usually takes me a couple of hours to pack everything back, if I have help. Usually, I do. I could just imagine Weston's face. I'm not the sadist of the two of us. Well, whenever one goes on vacation, the other one tags along. This year, I guess I kind of broke their tradition. I guess I do that a lot. Not that I particularly like Weston to think that I'm trying to steal his best friend away. Not that I even care what he thinks. It's just, I know how hard it is when it feels like your friends are abandoning you. At five-foot-seven, I was used to being tall. Up until the end of tenth grade, that is. I don't usually swear, but he always finds it so funny when I do. I clenched my teeth. When the arrogant asshole couldn't get me pissed off one way, he always did the sexual innuendo thing. I smiled, satisfied. I chirped. My eyes flicked over to Weston's bruised temple. I added, my voice laced with mock-concern. I shrieked and pulled the door shut as he bolted from the bed, his eyes filled with fury. She's sweet and smart and has a shoulder for anyone to cry on. A big romantic and severely lacking in the guy department. He's smart, sexy, and can charm any girl with a pulse. Any girl except Sam, that is.

And Adam seems to genuinely enjoy spoiling her; I guess she's the little princess he never had. Mom and Adam got married the May that I was in the eighth grade, so by the end of the summer, they figured it would be less hassle (on them) if they just sent me to MR for my high school years, like Adam did with Scott. But physical similarities aside, we're both highly opinionated (we have many a debate together), passionate about the things we love, have bad tempers (it takes a lot to really piss me off, but when I get mad…), and love chocolate chip ice cream. Scott used to detest me (he met Amanda first, and pretty much assumed I was as bitchy as my younger sister), and I wasn't exactly fond of him, either. Trust me, you wouldn't exactly be best friends with a guy whose boxers and other unmentionables you found all over your living room one Saturday morning. But then when we discovered the other liked BtVS as much as we each did, Tuesday night at eight became our time, and we gradually shed our judgments and stereotypes of one another. Oh, right. Sorry, got a little sidetracked. I do that often. So I got sent off to Maple at the beginning of ninth grade, and I pretty much lost contact with all of my friends, except for my lifelong best, Leah Green. You would think she'd be upset that her twin and older sister (who practically raised her, while Mom was at work) got booted off to boarding school. Alan's still got another three years after this, and I know it'll be weird for him without me around. I'll miss him, too. I'm glad he's managed to make genuine friends, though, like I have. There have been a couple of girls who tried to befriend me, just to get a date with Scott or Ian, but that was back in tenth grade, when I was young and naïve. Thank goodness I know better, now. I detest him. I loathe him. I despise him about as much as I love Buffy. That is how much I do not like him. But alas, I'm constantly forced to see him, since he's been Maddy's friend since they were in diapers, and he's pretty cool with Alan, too. He and Scott are like brothers though, which irks me to no end. How my brother can be so close with the Son of the Devil is beyond me. The time he came 'round when Leah was visiting, even she liked him. I'd never been hit on before, so naturally, it was a little shocking. And, I'm not afraid to admit this (because all it means, really, is that I have eyes), but David was – is – handsome. I would even go as far as to say he's a hottie. Of course, I'd have to be drunk to say that in mixed company, but you get what I mean. See, unlike the public schools in Toronto, which are pleasantly diverse, you could count the amount of non-Caucasian people with both hands. Besides myself, my brother, and David, there's I think one or two more Guyanese people. I'd rather be off-topic, though, if I'm going to have to describe David Weston's physical features. Okay, we've got thick black hair that always looks tousled, though I guess on him, it works. He's got nice eyes, too, I suppose. They're a deep shade of brown, almost black, and sometimes you can see flecks of golden brown. I see it a lot when we argue, so I guess it's when he's pissed that his eyes go like that. He's got a strong jaw, and he's built, but not overly so. He's, well, I guess you could say he's got the body of a track star and a football star combined. That may be because he is both a track star and a football star. He's pretty cute, I guess… if you go for that whole tall, dark, and handsome thing. And now back to why we don't get along. After he (rather crudely) hit on me, I (rather loudly) told him off. Then he insulted me, so I insulted him back (I may be quiet a lot of the time, but like I said, when I get mad, I give as good as I get). Thus began our three-year-long feud. Scott, Alan, and I usually make the three-hour-long drive up north as soon as we can, because we really don't like being at home with the parents and Mandy. But this year, we all went on a vacation to the Big Apple to spend some 'quality time' together, seeing as we apparently never do that anymore. So, the first day back at Maple. Madison, who had arrived the day before me, had already finished settling in, and was lying on her stomach on her plush queen-sized bed, leafing through the latest issue of Teen People that I'd gotten the other day. Yes, we may be the unwanted, but we're highly compensated for it. There's only one person that we know who comes to the window when he visits us. Keeping silent, I moved out from the closet, and began to pack away my books. I have a whole trunk of them. Books, that is. At the end of every year, I have to empty my shelves, and then I have to repack them in September. I'm one of the few students who actually use their bookshelves for books. In fact, I have so many books, that Maddy graciously gave me her shelf space. It usually takes me a couple of hours to pack everything back, if I have help. Usually, I do. I could just imagine Weston's face. I'm not the sadist of the two of us. Well, whenever one goes on vacation, the other one tags along. This year, I guess I kind of broke their tradition. I guess I do that a lot. Not that I particularly like Weston to think that I'm trying to steal his best friend away. Not that I even care what he thinks. It's just, I know how hard it is when it feels like your friends are abandoning you. At five-foot-seven, I was used to being tall. Up until the end of tenth grade, that is. I don't usually swear, but he always finds it so funny when I do. I clenched my teeth. When the arrogant asshole couldn't get me pissed off one way, he always did the sexual innuendo thing. I smiled, satisfied. I chirped. My eyes flicked over to Weston's bruised temple. I added, my voice laced with mock-concern. I shrieked and pulled the door shut as he bolted from the bed, his eyes filled with fury. She's sweet and smart and has a shoulder for anyone to cry on. A big romantic and severely lacking in the guy department. He's smart, sexy, and can charm any girl with a pulse. Any girl except Sam, that is. When they're made to work together for the school fundraiser, he'll make her see that there's a fine line between love and hate. She's got everything – money, looks, smarts, personality. But this year, her friends will find out that there's much more than meets the eye to Madison. Perhaps she doesn't have everything. Laid-back and laconic, Ian is one of Sam's closest friends, and she is one of the most precious people in his life. But when Ian makes a startling discovery, his friendship with Sam is put to the test. Also Sam's overprotective stepbrother. Scott's used to being shifted off to the side, to being second-string. He's used to temporary, not permanent. Then he starts having some intense not-so-platonic feelings for the one person he can't have. As they near closer and closer to graduation, hormones go into overdrive, friendships are tested, bonds are formed, and ties are severed. They will learn that family isn't just blood. It's much more than that. But ducks sound so much more interesting than trees. ). I'm just… quirky. Quirky and eccentric. Samantha Spade. Yeah, I know. . . One of the many students at Maple Ridge Academy. What is Maple Ridge, you ask? Well, as the student body so lovingly refers to it as, Maple Ridge is the school for the rich and unwanted. See, time was, you used to have to have some kick-ass talent to get into MR. Now, you just have to have a shitload of money to be able to pay the extortionist-like tuition fees (seriously, I could live off one year's tuition for the rest of my natural-born days). No longer is it a school for the exceptionally gifted and talented. Madison, well, what can I say about her? She's perfection personified, in my opinion. She's incredibly kind, she's incredibly intelligent, she's incredibly beautiful in the classic sense (think killer long legs, beautiful sky blue eyes, bright blonde hair, and impeccably flawless skin – she's been named one of the top five most gorgeous people on campus three years in a row already), and she's the Student Council President, co-captain of the cheerleading team, and a proud member of the Science Club. He's our resident basketball star. In fact, basketball's how he got to come to MR. See, unlike ninety-two-percent of the school population, Ian came on a scholarship. His dad passed away when he was eight, and his mother had to work two jobs to support him and his younger brother. He was able to get a full scholarship to Maple Ridge, and of course, he took it. He's, what, six-foot-five? Yeah, he's mad tall. He's got thick, wavy hair that's the most interesting shade of brown. It's so cool; if the light hits it just right, you can see strands of gold. His eyes are the most captivating shade of blue; Madison once said the exact shade was cerulean. And when he gets excited or something, you can see little slivers of navy or light blue. He has, by far, the nicest eyes I've ever seen. See, for as long as I could remember, it was Alan, Amanda, I, and Mom. We weren't exactly poor, but Mom had to work her ass off like, twenty-four-seven. It didn't help that Amanda is about the most materialistic and shallow person to ever grace this earth. When Mom got engaged to Adam, I have to admit, even I got sucked in by the whole luxury lifestyle. She's milking it for all it's worth.

They're a deep shade of brown, almost black, and sometimes you can see flecks of golden brown. I see it a lot when we argue, so I guess it's when he's pissed that his eyes go like that. He's got a strong jaw, and he's built, but not overly so. He's, well, I guess you could say he's got the body of a track star and a football star combined. That may be because he is both a track star and a football star. He's pretty cute, I guess… if you go for that whole tall, dark, and handsome thing. And now back to why we don't get along. After he (rather crudely) hit on me, I (rather loudly) told him off. Then he insulted me, so I insulted him back (I may be quiet a lot of the time, but like I said, when I get mad, I give as good as I get). Thus began our three-year-long feud. Scott, Alan, and I usually make the three-hour-long drive up north as soon as we can, because we really don't like being at home with the parents and Mandy. But this year, we all went on a vacation to the Big Apple to spend some 'quality time' together, seeing as we apparently never do that anymore. So, the first day back at Maple. Madison, who had arrived the day before me, had already finished settling in, and was lying on her stomach on her plush queen-sized bed, leafing through the latest issue of Teen People that I'd gotten the other day. Yes, we may be the unwanted, but we're highly compensated for it. There's only one person that we know who comes to the window when he visits us. Keeping silent, I moved out from the closet, and began to pack away my books. I have a whole trunk of them. Books, that is. At the end of every year, I have to empty my shelves, and then I have to repack them in September. I'm one of the few students who actually use their bookshelves for books. In fact, I have so many books, that Maddy graciously gave me her shelf space. It usually takes me a couple of hours to pack everything back, if I have help. Usually, I do. I could just imagine Weston's face. I'm not the sadist of the two of us. Well, whenever one goes on vacation, the other one tags along. This year, I guess I kind of broke their tradition. I guess I do that a lot. Not that I particularly like Weston to think that I'm trying to steal his best friend away. Not that I even care what he thinks. It's just, I know how hard it is when it feels like your friends are abandoning you. At five-foot-seven, I was used to being tall. Up until the end of tenth grade, that is. I don't usually swear, but he always finds it so funny when I do. I clenched my teeth. When the arrogant asshole couldn't get me pissed off one way, he always did the sexual innuendo thing. I smiled, satisfied. I chirped. My eyes flicked over to Weston's bruised temple. I added, my voice laced with mock-concern. I shrieked and pulled the door shut as he bolted from the bed, his eyes filled with fury. She's sweet and smart and has a shoulder for anyone to cry on. A big romantic and severely lacking in the guy department. He's smart, sexy, and can charm any girl with a pulse. Any girl except Sam, that is. When they're made to work together for the school fundraiser, he'll make her see that there's a fine line between love and hate. She's got everything – money, looks, smarts, personality. But this year, her friends will find out that there's much more than meets the eye to Madison. Perhaps she doesn't have everything. Laid-back and laconic, Ian is one of Sam's closest friends, and she is one of the most precious people in his life. But when Ian makes a startling discovery, his friendship with Sam is put to the test. Also Sam's overprotective stepbrother. Scott's used to being shifted off to the side, to being second-string. He's used to temporary, not permanent. Then he starts having some intense not-so-platonic feelings for the one person he can't have. As they near closer and closer to graduation, hormones go into overdrive, friendships are tested, bonds are formed, and ties are severed. They will learn that family isn't just blood. It's much more than that. But ducks sound so much more interesting than trees. ). I'm just… quirky. Quirky and eccentric. Samantha Spade. Yeah, I know. . . One of the many students at Maple Ridge Academy. What is Maple Ridge, you ask? Well, as the student body so lovingly refers to it as, Maple Ridge is the school for the rich and unwanted. See, time was, you used to have to have some kick-ass talent to get into MR. Now, you just have to have a shitload of money to be able to pay the extortionist-like tuition fees (seriously, I could live off one year's tuition for the rest of my natural-born days). No longer is it a school for the exceptionally gifted and talented. Madison, well, what can I say about her? She's perfection personified, in my opinion. She's incredibly kind, she's incredibly intelligent, she's incredibly beautiful in the classic sense (think killer long legs, beautiful sky blue eyes, bright blonde hair, and impeccably flawless skin – she's been named one of the top five most gorgeous people on campus three years in a row already), and she's the Student Council President, co-captain of the cheerleading team, and a proud member of the Science Club. He's our resident basketball star. In fact, basketball's how he got to come to MR. See, unlike ninety-two-percent of the school population, Ian came on a scholarship. His dad passed away when he was eight, and his mother had to work two jobs to support him and his younger brother. He was able to get a full scholarship to Maple Ridge, and of course, he took it. He's, what, six-foot-five? Yeah, he's mad tall. He's got thick, wavy hair that's the most interesting shade of brown. It's so cool; if the light hits it just right, you can see strands of gold. His eyes are the most captivating shade of blue; Madison once said the exact shade was cerulean. And when he gets excited or something, you can see little slivers of navy or light blue. He has, by far, the nicest eyes I've ever seen. See, for as long as I could remember, it was Alan, Amanda, I, and Mom. We weren't exactly poor, but Mom had to work her ass off like, twenty-four-seven. It didn't help that Amanda is about the most materialistic and shallow person to ever grace this earth. When Mom got engaged to Adam, I have to admit, even I got sucked in by the whole luxury lifestyle. She's milking it for all it's worth. And Adam seems to genuinely enjoy spoiling her; I guess she's the little princess he never had. Mom and Adam got married the May that I was in the eighth grade, so by the end of the summer, they figured it would be less hassle (on them) if they just sent me to MR for my high school years, like Adam did with Scott. But physical similarities aside, we're both highly opinionated (we have many a debate together), passionate about the things we love, have bad tempers (it takes a lot to really piss me off, but when I get mad…), and love chocolate chip ice cream. Scott used to detest me (he met Amanda first, and pretty much assumed I was as bitchy as my younger sister), and I wasn't exactly fond of him, either. Trust me, you wouldn't exactly be best friends with a guy whose boxers and other unmentionables you found all over your living room one Saturday morning. But then when we discovered the other liked BtVS as much as we each did, Tuesday night at eight became our time, and we gradually shed our judgments and stereotypes of one another. Oh, right. Sorry, got a little sidetracked. I do that often. So I got sent off to Maple at the beginning of ninth grade, and I pretty much lost contact with all of my friends, except for my lifelong best, Leah Green. You would think she'd be upset that her twin and older sister (who practically raised her, while Mom was at work) got booted off to boarding school. Alan's still got another three years after this, and I know it'll be weird for him without me around. I'll miss him, too. I'm glad he's managed to make genuine friends, though, like I have. There have been a couple of girls who tried to befriend me, just to get a date with Scott or Ian, but that was back in tenth grade, when I was young and naïve. Thank goodness I know better, now. I detest him. I loathe him. I despise him about as much as I love Buffy. That is how much I do not like him. But alas, I'm constantly forced to see him, since he's been Maddy's friend since they were in diapers, and he's pretty cool with Alan, too. He and Scott are like brothers though, which irks me to no end. How my brother can be so close with the Son of the Devil is beyond me. The time he came 'round when Leah was visiting, even she liked him. I'd never been hit on before, so naturally, it was a little shocking. And, I'm not afraid to admit this (because all it means, really, is that I have eyes), but David was – is – handsome. I would even go as far as to say he's a hottie. Of course, I'd have to be drunk to say that in mixed company, but you get what I mean. See, unlike the public schools in Toronto, which are pleasantly diverse, you could count the amount of non-Caucasian people with both hands. Besides myself, my brother, and David, there's I think one or two more Guyanese people. I'd rather be off-topic, though, if I'm going to have to describe David Weston's physical features.

A big romantic and severely lacking in the guy department. He's smart, sexy, and can charm any girl with a pulse. Any girl except Sam, that is. When they're made to work together for the school fundraiser, he'll make her see that there's a fine line between love and hate. She's got everything – money, looks, smarts, personality. But this year, her friends will find out that there's much more than meets the eye to Madison. Perhaps she doesn't have everything. Laid-back and laconic, Ian is one of Sam's closest friends, and she is one of the most precious people in his life. But when Ian makes a startling discovery, his friendship with Sam is put to the test. Also Sam's overprotective stepbrother. Scott's used to being shifted off to the side, to being second-string. He's used to temporary, not permanent. Then he starts having some intense not-so-platonic feelings for the one person he can't have. As they near closer and closer to graduation, hormones go into overdrive, friendships are tested, bonds are formed, and ties are severed. They will learn that family isn't just blood. It's much more than that. But ducks sound so much more interesting than trees. ). I'm just… quirky. Quirky and eccentric. Samantha Spade. Yeah, I know. . . One of the many students at Maple Ridge Academy. What is Maple Ridge, you ask? Well, as the student body so lovingly refers to it as, Maple Ridge is the school for the rich and unwanted. See, time was, you used to have to have some kick-ass talent to get into MR. Now, you just have to have a shitload of money to be able to pay the extortionist-like tuition fees (seriously, I could live off one year's tuition for the rest of my natural-born days). No longer is it a school for the exceptionally gifted and talented. Madison, well, what can I say about her? She's perfection personified, in my opinion. She's incredibly kind, she's incredibly intelligent, she's incredibly beautiful in the classic sense (think killer long legs, beautiful sky blue eyes, bright blonde hair, and impeccably flawless skin – she's been named one of the top five most gorgeous people on campus three years in a row already), and she's the Student Council President, co-captain of the cheerleading team, and a proud member of the Science Club. He's our resident basketball star. In fact, basketball's how he got to come to MR. See, unlike ninety-two-percent of the school population, Ian came on a scholarship. His dad passed away when he was eight, and his mother had to work two jobs to support him and his younger brother. He was able to get a full scholarship to Maple Ridge, and of course, he took it. He's, what, six-foot-five? Yeah, he's mad tall. He's got thick, wavy hair that's the most interesting shade of brown. It's so cool; if the light hits it just right, you can see strands of gold. His eyes are the most captivating shade of blue; Madison once said the exact shade was cerulean. And when he gets excited or something, you can see little slivers of navy or light blue. He has, by far, the nicest eyes I've ever seen. See, for as long as I could remember, it was Alan, Amanda, I, and Mom. We weren't exactly poor, but Mom had to work her ass off like, twenty-four-seven. It didn't help that Amanda is about the most materialistic and shallow person to ever grace this earth. When Mom got engaged to Adam, I have to admit, even I got sucked in by the whole luxury lifestyle. She's milking it for all it's worth. And Adam seems to genuinely enjoy spoiling her; I guess she's the little princess he never had. Mom and Adam got married the May that I was in the eighth grade, so by the end of the summer, they figured it would be less hassle (on them) if they just sent me to MR for my high school years, like Adam did with Scott. But physical similarities aside, we're both highly opinionated (we have many a debate together), passionate about the things we love, have bad tempers (it takes a lot to really piss me off, but when I get mad…), and love chocolate chip ice cream. Scott used to detest me (he met Amanda first, and pretty much assumed I was as bitchy as my younger sister), and I wasn't exactly fond of him, either. Trust me, you wouldn't exactly be best friends with a guy whose boxers and other unmentionables you found all over your living room one Saturday morning. But then when we discovered the other liked BtVS as much as we each did, Tuesday night at eight became our time, and we gradually shed our judgments and stereotypes of one another. Oh, right. Sorry, got a little sidetracked. I do that often. So I got sent off to Maple at the beginning of ninth grade, and I pretty much lost contact with all of my friends, except for my lifelong best, Leah Green. You would think she'd be upset that her twin and older sister (who practically raised her, while Mom was at work) got booted off to boarding school. Alan's still got another three years after this, and I know it'll be weird for him without me around. I'll miss him, too. I'm glad he's managed to make genuine friends, though, like I have. There have been a couple of girls who tried to befriend me, just to get a date with Scott or Ian, but that was back in tenth grade, when I was young and naïve. Thank goodness I know better, now. I detest him. I loathe him. I despise him about as much as I love Buffy. That is how much I do not like him. But alas, I'm constantly forced to see him, since he's been Maddy's friend since they were in diapers, and he's pretty cool with Alan, too. He and Scott are like brothers though, which irks me to no end. How my brother can be so close with the Son of the Devil is beyond me. The time he came 'round when Leah was visiting, even she liked him. I'd never been hit on before, so naturally, it was a little shocking. And, I'm not afraid to admit this (because all it means, really, is that I have eyes), but David was – is – handsome. I would even go as far as to say he's a hottie. Of course, I'd have to be drunk to say that in mixed company, but you get what I mean. See, unlike the public schools in Toronto, which are pleasantly diverse, you could count the amount of non-Caucasian people with both hands. Besides myself, my brother, and David, there's I think one or two more Guyanese people. I'd rather be off-topic, though, if I'm going to have to describe David Weston's physical features. Okay, we've got thick black hair that always looks tousled, though I guess on him, it works. He's got nice eyes, too, I suppose. They're a deep shade of brown, almost black, and sometimes you can see flecks of golden brown. I see it a lot when we argue, so I guess it's when he's pissed that his eyes go like that. He's got a strong jaw, and he's built, but not overly so. He's, well, I guess you could say he's got the body of a track star and a football star combined. That may be because he is both a track star and a football star. He's pretty cute, I guess… if you go for that whole tall, dark, and handsome thing. And now back to why we don't get along. After he (rather crudely) hit on me, I (rather loudly) told him off. Then he insulted me, so I insulted him back (I may be quiet a lot of the time, but like I said, when I get mad, I give as good as I get). Thus began our three-year-long feud. Scott, Alan, and I usually make the three-hour-long drive up north as soon as we can, because we really don't like being at home with the parents and Mandy. But this year, we all went on a vacation to the Big Apple to spend some 'quality time' together, seeing as we apparently never do that anymore. So, the first day back at Maple. Madison, who had arrived the day before me, had already finished settling in, and was lying on her stomach on her plush queen-sized bed, leafing through the latest issue of Teen People that I'd gotten the other day. Yes, we may be the unwanted, but we're highly compensated for it. There's only one person that we know who comes to the window when he visits us. Keeping silent, I moved out from the closet, and began to pack away my books. I have a whole trunk of them. Books, that is. At the end of every year, I have to empty my shelves, and then I have to repack them in September. I'm one of the few students who actually use their bookshelves for books. In fact, I have so many books, that Maddy graciously gave me her shelf space. It usually takes me a couple of hours to pack everything back, if I have help. Usually, I do. I could just imagine Weston's face. I'm not the sadist of the two of us. Well, whenever one goes on vacation, the other one tags along. This year, I guess I kind of broke their tradition. I guess I do that a lot. Not that I particularly like Weston to think that I'm trying to steal his best friend away. Not that I even care what he thinks. It's just, I know how hard it is when it feels like your friends are abandoning you. At five-foot-seven, I was used to being tall. Up until the end of tenth grade, that is. I don't usually swear, but he always finds it so funny when I do. I clenched my teeth. When the arrogant asshole couldn't get me pissed off one way, he always did the sexual innuendo thing. I smiled, satisfied. I chirped. My eyes flicked over to Weston's bruised temple. I added, my voice laced with mock-concern. I shrieked and pulled the door shut as he bolted from the bed, his eyes filled with fury. She's sweet and smart and has a shoulder for anyone to cry on.

We weren't exactly poor, but Mom had to work her ass off like, twenty-four-seven. It didn't help that Amanda is about the most materialistic and shallow person to ever grace this earth. When Mom got engaged to Adam, I have to admit, even I got sucked in by the whole luxury lifestyle. She's milking it for all it's worth. And Adam seems to genuinely enjoy spoiling her; I guess she's the little princess he never had. Mom and Adam got married the May that I was in the eighth grade, so by the end of the summer, they figured it would be less hassle (on them) if they just sent me to MR for my high school years, like Adam did with Scott. But physical similarities aside, we're both highly opinionated (we have many a debate together), passionate about the things we love, have bad tempers (it takes a lot to really piss me off, but when I get mad…), and love chocolate chip ice cream. Scott used to detest me (he met Amanda first, and pretty much assumed I was as bitchy as my younger sister), and I wasn't exactly fond of him, either. Trust me, you wouldn't exactly be best friends with a guy whose boxers and other unmentionables you found all over your living room one Saturday morning. But then when we discovered the other liked BtVS as much as we each did, Tuesday night at eight became our time, and we gradually shed our judgments and stereotypes of one another. Oh, right. Sorry, got a little sidetracked. I do that often. So I got sent off to Maple at the beginning of ninth grade, and I pretty much lost contact with all of my friends, except for my lifelong best, Leah Green. You would think she'd be upset that her twin and older sister (who practically raised her, while Mom was at work) got booted off to boarding school. Alan's still got another three years after this, and I know it'll be weird for him without me around. I'll miss him, too. I'm glad he's managed to make genuine friends, though, like I have. There have been a couple of girls who tried to befriend me, just to get a date with Scott or Ian, but that was back in tenth grade, when I was young and naïve. Thank goodness I know better, now. I detest him. I loathe him. I despise him about as much as I love Buffy. That is how much I do not like him. But alas, I'm constantly forced to see him, since he's been Maddy's friend since they were in diapers, and he's pretty cool with Alan, too. He and Scott are like brothers though, which irks me to no end. How my brother can be so close with the Son of the Devil is beyond me. The time he came 'round when Leah was visiting, even she liked him. I'd never been hit on before, so naturally, it was a little shocking. And, I'm not afraid to admit this (because all it means, really, is that I have eyes), but David was – is – handsome. I would even go as far as to say he's a hottie. Of course, I'd have to be drunk to say that in mixed company, but you get what I mean. See, unlike the public schools in Toronto, which are pleasantly diverse, you could count the amount of non-Caucasian people with both hands. Besides myself, my brother, and David, there's I think one or two more Guyanese people. I'd rather be off-topic, though, if I'm going to have to describe David Weston's physical features. Okay, we've got thick black hair that always looks tousled, though I guess on him, it works. He's got nice eyes, too, I suppose. They're a deep shade of brown, almost black, and sometimes you can see flecks of golden brown. I see it a lot when we argue, so I guess it's when he's pissed that his eyes go like that. He's got a strong jaw, and he's built, but not overly so. He's, well, I guess you could say he's got the body of a track star and a football star combined. That may be because he is both a track star and a football star. He's pretty cute, I guess… if you go for that whole tall, dark, and handsome thing. And now back to why we don't get along. After he (rather crudely) hit on me, I (rather loudly) told him off. Then he insulted me, so I insulted him back (I may be quiet a lot of the time, but like I said, when I get mad, I give as good as I get). Thus began our three-year-long feud. Scott, Alan, and I usually make the three-hour-long drive up north as soon as we can, because we really don't like being at home with the parents and Mandy. But this year, we all went on a vacation to the Big Apple to spend some 'quality time' together, seeing as we apparently never do that anymore. So, the first day back at Maple. Madison, who had arrived the day before me, had already finished settling in, and was lying on her stomach on her plush queen-sized bed, leafing through the latest issue of Teen People that I'd gotten the other day. Yes, we may be the unwanted, but we're highly compensated for it. There's only one person that we know who comes to the window when he visits us. Keeping silent, I moved out from the closet, and began to pack away my books. I have a whole trunk of them. Books, that is. At the end of every year, I have to empty my shelves, and then I have to repack them in September. I'm one of the few students who actually use their bookshelves for books. In fact, I have so many books, that Maddy graciously gave me her shelf space. It usually takes me a couple of hours to pack everything back, if I have help. Usually, I do. I could just imagine Weston's face. I'm not the sadist of the two of us. Well, whenever one goes on vacation, the other one tags along. This year, I guess I kind of broke their tradition. I guess I do that a lot. Not that I particularly like Weston to think that I'm trying to steal his best friend away. Not that I even care what he thinks. It's just, I know how hard it is when it feels like your friends are abandoning you. At five-foot-seven, I was used to being tall. Up until the end of tenth grade, that is. I don't usually swear, but he always finds it so funny when I do. I clenched my teeth. When the arrogant asshole couldn't get me pissed off one way, he always did the sexual innuendo thing. I smiled, satisfied. I chirped. My eyes flicked over to Weston's bruised temple. I added, my voice laced with mock-concern. I shrieked and pulled the door shut as he bolted from the bed, his eyes filled with fury. She's sweet and smart and has a shoulder for anyone to cry on. A big romantic and severely lacking in the guy department. He's smart, sexy, and can charm any girl with a pulse. Any girl except Sam, that is. When they're made to work together for the school fundraiser, he'll make her see that there's a fine line between love and hate. She's got everything – money, looks, smarts, personality. But this year, her friends will find out that there's much more than meets the eye to Madison. Perhaps she doesn't have everything. Laid-back and laconic, Ian is one of Sam's closest friends, and she is one of the most precious people in his life. But when Ian makes a startling discovery, his friendship with Sam is put to the test. Also Sam's overprotective stepbrother. Scott's used to being shifted off to the side, to being second-string. He's used to temporary, not permanent. Then he starts having some intense not-so-platonic feelings for the one person he can't have. As they near closer and closer to graduation, hormones go into overdrive, friendships are tested, bonds are formed, and ties are severed. They will learn that family isn't just blood. It's much more than that. But ducks sound so much more interesting than trees. ). I'm just… quirky. Quirky and eccentric. Samantha Spade. Yeah, I know. . . One of the many students at Maple Ridge Academy. What is Maple Ridge, you ask? Well, as the student body so lovingly refers to it as, Maple Ridge is the school for the rich and unwanted. See, time was, you used to have to have some kick-ass talent to get into MR. Now, you just have to have a shitload of money to be able to pay the extortionist-like tuition fees (seriously, I could live off one year's tuition for the rest of my natural-born days). No longer is it a school for the exceptionally gifted and talented. Madison, well, what can I say about her? She's perfection personified, in my opinion. She's incredibly kind, she's incredibly intelligent, she's incredibly beautiful in the classic sense (think killer long legs, beautiful sky blue eyes, bright blonde hair, and impeccably flawless skin – she's been named one of the top five most gorgeous people on campus three years in a row already), and she's the Student Council President, co-captain of the cheerleading team, and a proud member of the Science Club. He's our resident basketball star. In fact, basketball's how he got to come to MR. See, unlike ninety-two-percent of the school population, Ian came on a scholarship. His dad passed away when he was eight, and his mother had to work two jobs to support him and his younger brother. He was able to get a full scholarship to Maple Ridge, and of course, he took it. He's, what, six-foot-five? Yeah, he's mad tall. He's got thick, wavy hair that's the most interesting shade of brown. It's so cool; if the light hits it just right, you can see strands of gold. His eyes are the most captivating shade of blue; Madison once said the exact shade was cerulean. And when he gets excited or something, you can see little slivers of navy or light blue. He has, by far, the nicest eyes I've ever seen. See, for as long as I could remember, it was Alan, Amanda, I, and Mom.

Besides myself, my brother, and David, there's I think one or two more Guyanese people. I'd rather be off-topic, though, if I'm going to have to describe David Weston's physical features. Okay, we've got thick black hair that always looks tousled, though I guess on him, it works. He's got nice eyes, too, I suppose. They're a deep shade of brown, almost black, and sometimes you can see flecks of golden brown. I see it a lot when we argue, so I guess it's when he's pissed that his eyes go like that. He's got a strong jaw, and he's built, but not overly so. He's, well, I guess you could say he's got the body of a track star and a football star combined. That may be because he is both a track star and a football star. He's pretty cute, I guess… if you go for that whole tall, dark, and handsome thing. And now back to why we don't get along. After he (rather crudely) hit on me, I (rather loudly) told him off. Then he insulted me, so I insulted him back (I may be quiet a lot of the time, but like I said, when I get mad, I give as good as I get). Thus began our three-year-long feud. Scott, Alan, and I usually make the three-hour-long drive up north as soon as we can, because we really don't like being at home with the parents and Mandy. But this year, we all went on a vacation to the Big Apple to spend some 'quality time' together, seeing as we apparently never do that anymore. So, the first day back at Maple. Madison, who had arrived the day before me, had already finished settling in, and was lying on her stomach on her plush queen-sized bed, leafing through the latest issue of Teen People that I'd gotten the other day. Yes, we may be the unwanted, but we're highly compensated for it. There's only one person that we know who comes to the window when he visits us. Keeping silent, I moved out from the closet, and began to pack away my books. I have a whole trunk of them. Books, that is. At the end of every year, I have to empty my shelves, and then I have to repack them in September. I'm one of the few students who actually use their bookshelves for books. In fact, I have so many books, that Maddy graciously gave me her shelf space. It usually takes me a couple of hours to pack everything back, if I have help. Usually, I do. I could just imagine Weston's face. I'm not the sadist of the two of us. Well, whenever one goes on vacation, the other one tags along. This year, I guess I kind of broke their tradition. I guess I do that a lot. Not that I particularly like Weston to think that I'm trying to steal his best friend away. Not that I even care what he thinks. It's just, I know how hard it is when it feels like your friends are abandoning you. At five-foot-seven, I was used to being tall. Up until the end of tenth grade, that is. I don't usually swear, but he always finds it so funny when I do. I clenched my teeth. When the arrogant asshole couldn't get me pissed off one way, he always did the sexual innuendo thing. I smiled, satisfied. I chirped. My eyes flicked over to Weston's bruised temple. I added, my voice laced with mock-concern. I shrieked and pulled the door shut as he bolted from the bed, his eyes filled with fury. She's sweet and smart and has a shoulder for anyone to cry on. A big romantic and severely lacking in the guy department. He's smart, sexy, and can charm any girl with a pulse. Any girl except Sam, that is. When they're made to work together for the school fundraiser, he'll make her see that there's a fine line between love and hate. She's got everything – money, looks, smarts, personality. But this year, her friends will find out that there's much more than meets the eye to Madison. Perhaps she doesn't have everything. Laid-back and laconic, Ian is one of Sam's closest friends, and she is one of the most precious people in his life. But when Ian makes a startling discovery, his friendship with Sam is put to the test. Also Sam's overprotective stepbrother. Scott's used to being shifted off to the side, to being second-string. He's used to temporary, not permanent. Then he starts having some intense not-so-platonic feelings for the one person he can't have. As they near closer and closer to graduation, hormones go into overdrive, friendships are tested, bonds are formed, and ties are severed. They will learn that family isn't just blood. It's much more than that. But ducks sound so much more interesting than trees. ). I'm just… quirky. Quirky and eccentric. Samantha Spade. Yeah, I know. . . One of the many students at Maple Ridge Academy. What is Maple Ridge, you ask? Well, as the student body so lovingly refers to it as, Maple Ridge is the school for the rich and unwanted. See, time was, you used to have to have some kick-ass talent to get into MR. Now, you just have to have a shitload of money to be able to pay the extortionist-like tuition fees (seriously, I could live off one year's tuition for the rest of my natural-born days). No longer is it a school for the exceptionally gifted and talented. Madison, well, what can I say about her? She's perfection personified, in my opinion. She's incredibly kind, she's incredibly intelligent, she's incredibly beautiful in the classic sense (think killer long legs, beautiful sky blue eyes, bright blonde hair, and impeccably flawless skin – she's been named one of the top five most gorgeous people on campus three years in a row already), and she's the Student Council President, co-captain of the cheerleading team, and a proud member of the Science Club. He's our resident basketball star. In fact, basketball's how he got to come to MR. See, unlike ninety-two-percent of the school population, Ian came on a scholarship. His dad passed away when he was eight, and his mother had to work two jobs to support him and his younger brother. He was able to get a full scholarship to Maple Ridge, and of course, he took it. He's, what, six-foot-five? Yeah, he's mad tall. He's got thick, wavy hair that's the most interesting shade of brown. It's so cool; if the light hits it just right, you can see strands of gold. His eyes are the most captivating shade of blue; Madison once said the exact shade was cerulean. And when he gets excited or something, you can see little slivers of navy or light blue. He has, by far, the nicest eyes I've ever seen. See, for as long as I could remember, it was Alan, Amanda, I, and Mom. We weren't exactly poor, but Mom had to work her ass off like, twenty-four-seven. It didn't help that Amanda is about the most materialistic and shallow person to ever grace this earth. When Mom got engaged to Adam, I have to admit, even I got sucked in by the whole luxury lifestyle. She's milking it for all it's worth. And Adam seems to genuinely enjoy spoiling her; I guess she's the little princess he never had. Mom and Adam got married the May that I was in the eighth grade, so by the end of the summer, they figured it would be less hassle (on them) if they just sent me to MR for my high school years, like Adam did with Scott. But physical similarities aside, we're both highly opinionated (we have many a debate together), passionate about the things we love, have bad tempers (it takes a lot to really piss me off, but when I get mad…), and love chocolate chip ice cream. Scott used to detest me (he met Amanda first, and pretty much assumed I was as bitchy as my younger sister), and I wasn't exactly fond of him, either. Trust me, you wouldn't exactly be best friends with a guy whose boxers and other unmentionables you found all over your living room one Saturday morning. But then when we discovered the other liked BtVS as much as we each did, Tuesday night at eight became our time, and we gradually shed our judgments and stereotypes of one another. Oh, right. Sorry, got a little sidetracked. I do that often. So I got sent off to Maple at the beginning of ninth grade, and I pretty much lost contact with all of my friends, except for my lifelong best, Leah Green. You would think she'd be upset that her twin and older sister (who practically raised her, while Mom was at work) got booted off to boarding school. Alan's still got another three years after this, and I know it'll be weird for him without me around. I'll miss him, too. I'm glad he's managed to make genuine friends, though, like I have. There have been a couple of girls who tried to befriend me, just to get a date with Scott or Ian, but that was back in tenth grade, when I was young and naïve. Thank goodness I know better, now. I detest him. I loathe him. I despise him about as much as I love Buffy. That is how much I do not like him. But alas, I'm constantly forced to see him, since he's been Maddy's friend since they were in diapers, and he's pretty cool with Alan, too. He and Scott are like brothers though, which irks me to no end. How my brother can be so close with the Son of the Devil is beyond me. The time he came 'round when Leah was visiting, even she liked him. I'd never been hit on before, so naturally, it was a little shocking. And, I'm not afraid to admit this (because all it means, really, is that I have eyes), but David was – is – handsome. I would even go as far as to say he's a hottie. Of course, I'd have to be drunk to say that in mixed company, but you get what I mean. See, unlike the public schools in Toronto, which are pleasantly diverse, you could count the amount of non-Caucasian people with both hands.

I shrieked and pulled the door shut as he bolted from the bed, his eyes filled with fury. She's sweet and smart and has a shoulder for anyone to cry on. A big romantic and severely lacking in the guy department. He's smart, sexy, and can charm any girl with a pulse. Any girl except Sam, that is. When they're made to work together for the school fundraiser, he'll make her see that there's a fine line between love and hate. She's got everything – money, looks, smarts, personality. But this year, her friends will find out that there's much more than meets the eye to Madison. Perhaps she doesn't have everything. Laid-back and laconic, Ian is one of Sam's closest friends, and she is one of the most precious people in his life. But when Ian makes a startling discovery, his friendship with Sam is put to the test. Also Sam's overprotective stepbrother. Scott's used to being shifted off to the side, to being second-string. He's used to temporary, not permanent. Then he starts having some intense not-so-platonic feelings for the one person he can't have. As they near closer and closer to graduation, hormones go into overdrive, friendships are tested, bonds are formed, and ties are severed. They will learn that family isn't just blood. It's much more than that. But ducks sound so much more interesting than trees. ). I'm just… quirky. Quirky and eccentric. Samantha Spade. Yeah, I know. . . One of the many students at Maple Ridge Academy. What is Maple Ridge, you ask? Well, as the student body so lovingly refers to it as, Maple Ridge is the school for the rich and unwanted. See, time was, you used to have to have some kick-ass talent to get into MR. Now, you just have to have a shitload of money to be able to pay the extortionist-like tuition fees (seriously, I could live off one year's tuition for the rest of my natural-born days). No longer is it a school for the exceptionally gifted and talented. Madison, well, what can I say about her? She's perfection personified, in my opinion. She's incredibly kind, she's incredibly intelligent, she's incredibly beautiful in the classic sense (think killer long legs, beautiful sky blue eyes, bright blonde hair, and impeccably flawless skin – she's been named one of the top five most gorgeous people on campus three years in a row already), and she's the Student Council President, co-captain of the cheerleading team, and a proud member of the Science Club. He's our resident basketball star. In fact, basketball's how he got to come to MR. See, unlike ninety-two-percent of the school population, Ian came on a scholarship. His dad passed away when he was eight, and his mother had to work two jobs to support him and his younger brother. He was able to get a full scholarship to Maple Ridge, and of course, he took it. He's, what, six-foot-five? Yeah, he's mad tall. He's got thick, wavy hair that's the most interesting shade of brown. It's so cool; if the light hits it just right, you can see strands of gold. His eyes are the most captivating shade of blue; Madison once said the exact shade was cerulean. And when he gets excited or something, you can see little slivers of navy or light blue. He has, by far, the nicest eyes I've ever seen. See, for as long as I could remember, it was Alan, Amanda, I, and Mom. We weren't exactly poor, but Mom had to work her ass off like, twenty-four-seven. It didn't help that Amanda is about the most materialistic and shallow person to ever grace this earth. When Mom got engaged to Adam, I have to admit, even I got sucked in by the whole luxury lifestyle. She's milking it for all it's worth. And Adam seems to genuinely enjoy spoiling her; I guess she's the little princess he never had. Mom and Adam got married the May that I was in the eighth grade, so by the end of the summer, they figured it would be less hassle (on them) if they just sent me to MR for my high school years, like Adam did with Scott. But physical similarities aside, we're both highly opinionated (we have many a debate together), passionate about the things we love, have bad tempers (it takes a lot to really piss me off, but when I get mad…), and love chocolate chip ice cream. Scott used to detest me (he met Amanda first, and pretty much assumed I was as bitchy as my younger sister), and I wasn't exactly fond of him, either. Trust me, you wouldn't exactly be best friends with a guy whose boxers and other unmentionables you found all over your living room one Saturday morning. But then when we discovered the other liked BtVS as much as we each did, Tuesday night at eight became our time, and we gradually shed our judgments and stereotypes of one another. Oh, right. Sorry, got a little sidetracked. I do that often. So I got sent off to Maple at the beginning of ninth grade, and I pretty much lost contact with all of my friends, except for my lifelong best, Leah Green. You would think she'd be upset that her twin and older sister (who practically raised her, while Mom was at work) got booted off to boarding school. Alan's still got another three years after this, and I know it'll be weird for him without me around. I'll miss him, too. I'm glad he's managed to make genuine friends, though, like I have. There have been a couple of girls who tried to befriend me, just to get a date with Scott or Ian, but that was back in tenth grade, when I was young and naïve. Thank goodness I know better, now. I detest him. I loathe him. I despise him about as much as I love Buffy. That is how much I do not like him. But alas, I'm constantly forced to see him, since he's been Maddy's friend since they were in diapers, and he's pretty cool with Alan, too. He and Scott are like brothers though, which irks me to no end. How my brother can be so close with the Son of the Devil is beyond me. The time he came 'round when Leah was visiting, even she liked him. I'd never been hit on before, so naturally, it was a little shocking. And, I'm not afraid to admit this (because all it means, really, is that I have eyes), but David was – is – handsome. I would even go as far as to say he's a hottie. Of course, I'd have to be drunk to say that in mixed company, but you get what I mean. See, unlike the public schools in Toronto, which are pleasantly diverse, you could count the amount of non-Caucasian people with both hands. Besides myself, my brother, and David, there's I think one or two more Guyanese people. I'd rather be off-topic, though, if I'm going to have to describe David Weston's physical features. Okay, we've got thick black hair that always looks tousled, though I guess on him, it works. He's got nice eyes, too, I suppose. They're a deep shade of brown, almost black, and sometimes you can see flecks of golden brown. I see it a lot when we argue, so I guess it's when he's pissed that his eyes go like that. He's got a strong jaw, and he's built, but not overly so. He's, well, I guess you could say he's got the body of a track star and a football star combined. That may be because he is both a track star and a football star. He's pretty cute, I guess… if you go for that whole tall, dark, and handsome thing. And now back to why we don't get along. After he (rather crudely) hit on me, I (rather loudly) told him off. Then he insulted me, so I insulted him back (I may be quiet a lot of the time, but like I said, when I get mad, I give as good as I get). Thus began our three-year-long feud. Scott, Alan, and I usually make the three-hour-long drive up north as soon as we can, because we really don't like being at home with the parents and Mandy. But this year, we all went on a vacation to the Big Apple to spend some 'quality time' together, seeing as we apparently never do that anymore. So, the first day back at Maple. Madison, who had arrived the day before me, had already finished settling in, and was lying on her stomach on her plush queen-sized bed, leafing through the latest issue of Teen People that I'd gotten the other day. Yes, we may be the unwanted, but we're highly compensated for it. There's only one person that we know who comes to the window when he visits us. Keeping silent, I moved out from the closet, and began to pack away my books. I have a whole trunk of them. Books, that is. At the end of every year, I have to empty my shelves, and then I have to repack them in September. I'm one of the few students who actually use their bookshelves for books. In fact, I have so many books, that Maddy graciously gave me her shelf space. It usually takes me a couple of hours to pack everything back, if I have help. Usually, I do. I could just imagine Weston's face. I'm not the sadist of the two of us. Well, whenever one goes on vacation, the other one tags along. This year, I guess I kind of broke their tradition. I guess I do that a lot. Not that I particularly like Weston to think that I'm trying to steal his best friend away. Not that I even care what he thinks. It's just, I know how hard it is when it feels like your friends are abandoning you. At five-foot-seven, I was used to being tall. Up until the end of tenth grade, that is. I don't usually swear, but he always finds it so funny when I do. I clenched my teeth. When the arrogant asshole couldn't get me pissed off one way, he always did the sexual innuendo thing.

I shrieked and pulled the door shut as he bolted from the bed, his eyes filled with fury. They'd never really been friends, but they'd never really been enemies. She likes baking, he likes art, and they'd never really had much to say to each other. Then one day, in sophomore year, Brody sees Felicia changing. And Felicia sees Brody see her changing. And then Felicia does something neither of them expect: she smiles. From then on, they've learned to be what Felicia and Brody like to call  He's there, she's there. They're there, but they're not there together. Being  is a state of indifference, Felicia decides. I hope you'll read it. I undid my jeans and shoved them to my ankles, being careful to leave my underpants in place. I glanced out my window, feeling his eyes on me. But Brody just sat calmly on his bed, reading what looked like a Harry Potter book. I knew he was watching me, though. Well. At the last split second before I dropped the cord, his eyes leapt from the pages to meet mine. Playing with the frayed ends of my old childhood blanket—yes, I still had it on my bed. Jeez, it wasn't like I sucked my thumb still— I thought about me and Brody. Brody and me. When I was six, Mrs. Riesman moved to an Elderly Housing Community (PC for "Old Folks' Home) and in moved the Hansens. Brody's about her age, I think? He's around here somewhere—Brody! It wasn't who we about who we were, it was about who we'd been. Obnoxious little munchkins with no respect for anything, let alone each other. After that, we'd talked very little. The schools we'd gone to since then had been big, and I'd rarely had him in any of my classes. Even though we were next-door-neighbors, we had never tried to get to know each other. I mean, at block parties and stuff we'd crash in his living room, and he'd whip my butt at all his assorted video games. He never drank much, but it was evidently enough to make him forget about Felicia McAdams. Not that it would take much to do that— as I'd said, we weren't exactly friends. Just sort of… there. He was there, I was there. It was early November; she was fifteen, I'd just turned sixteen. I guess she didn't realize that her blinds were up, or maybe she just didn't care. Whatever the case, she walked into her bedroom with nothing but a long T-shit on. It's not like I saw anything. She slid on a black bra and struggled with the catch for a moment before it hooked. She looked half-shocked, half-flattered. She didn't even look mad. Her dark hair looked wet, and I thought for a bit about how she'd probably just been in the shower. Green or blue? Definitely green. That's it, Brody, keep it cool. I wasn't even supposed to like her. I did. I figured by now it was a show, because if she didn't know I was watching, she was an idiot. And Felicia was not an idiot; she wasn't, you know, top-of-the-class student-body-president resident-virgin (was she a virgin? ) or anything, but she was smart. She made decent grades, and she baked cookies all the time. Too much. You'd think she'd get tired of them eventually. On top of all this, she was really, really bad at video games. Like, chronically bad. Sorry, one-track mind, here. I wasn't positive back then, though. It really was hard to tell, you know? She had a serious boyfriend: Liam O'Malley. She'd been dating him for a long time—since the end of tenth grade, I think. They'd broken up and gotten back together several times—I didn't know how many. So why get together again, only to have the same problems arise? I supposed it just came down to emotion: Felicia and Liam just couldn't stay away from each other. Where you care so much that you don't care about anything else. My friend Nick said I was being a girl about it, going on about relationships all the time. Then he got all serious about it, saying I probably wanted a relationship so bad because my parents' relationship sucked. Or it used to suck, before it ended. The end was the best part, I think. When mom stopped crying and started healing. He turned eighteen two weeks before I did. Well, almost never. Felicia never mentioned it, but I knew she remembered the day it happened, too. Not that I was going to talk about it, because I wasn't. I didn't talk much about anything; I liked reading better. Nick did, though. If I was reading at lunch, he'd just sit next to me and tell off our other friends when they tried to get my attention. Not to bring this up again, but I know this for a fact. I sat on the end of my bed for a long time after that, wondering exactly why Felicia and I weren't friends. We should have been. She was always around, and I was always around. I've already got three and a half chapters written besides this. I think I can keep myself in check long enough to finish it. But only if people like it. So, tell me what you think. I've got a basic plan for the plot already, but I'm always open for suggestion. This'll be a big one, guys. Let's see how it works out. They'd never really been friends, but they'd never really been enemies. She likes baking, he likes art, and they'd never really had much to say to each other. Then one day, in sophomore year, Brody sees Felicia changing. And Felicia sees Brody see her changing. And then Felicia does something neither of them expect: she smiles. From then on, they've learned to be what Felicia and Brody like to call  He's there, she's there. They're there, but they're not there together. Being  is a state of indifference, Felicia decides. I hope you'll read it. I undid my jeans and shoved them to my ankles, being careful to leave my underpants in place. I glanced out my window, feeling his eyes on me. But Brody just sat calmly on his bed, reading what looked like a Harry Potter book. I knew he was watching me, though. Well. At the last split second before I dropped the cord, his eyes leapt from the pages to meet mine. Playing with the frayed ends of my old childhood blanket—yes, I still had it on my bed. Jeez, it wasn't like I sucked my thumb still— I thought about me and Brody. Brody and me. When I was six, Mrs. Riesman moved to an Elderly Housing Community (PC for "Old Folks' Home) and in moved the Hansens. Brody's about her age, I think? He's around here somewhere—Brody! It wasn't who we about who we were, it was about who we'd been. Obnoxious little munchkins with no respect for anything, let alone each other. After that, we'd talked very little. The schools we'd gone to since then had been big, and I'd rarely had him in any of my classes. Even though we were next-door-neighbors, we had never tried to get to know each other. I mean, at block parties and stuff we'd crash in his living room, and he'd whip my butt at all his assorted video games. He never drank much, but it was evidently enough to make him forget about Felicia McAdams. Not that it would take much to do that— as I'd said, we weren't exactly friends. Just sort of… there. He was there, I was there. It was early November; she was fifteen, I'd just turned sixteen. I guess she didn't realize that her blinds were up, or maybe she just didn't care. Whatever the case, she walked into her bedroom with nothing but a long T-shit on. It's not like I saw anything. She slid on a black bra and struggled with the catch for a moment before it hooked. She looked half-shocked, half-flattered. She didn't even look mad. Her dark hair looked wet, and I thought for a bit about how she'd probably just been in the shower. Green or blue? Definitely green. That's it, Brody, keep it cool. I wasn't even supposed to like her. I did. I figured by now it was a show, because if she didn't know I was watching, she was an idiot.

I've got a basic plan for the plot already, but I'm always open for suggestion. This'll be a big one, guys. Let's see how it works out. They'd never really been friends, but they'd never really been enemies. She likes baking, he likes art, and they'd never really had much to say to each other. Then one day, in sophomore year, Brody sees Felicia changing. And Felicia sees Brody see her changing. And then Felicia does something neither of them expect: she smiles. From then on, they've learned to be what Felicia and Brody like to call  He's there, she's there. They're there, but they're not there together. Being  is a state of indifference, Felicia decides. I hope you'll read it. I undid my jeans and shoved them to my ankles, being careful to leave my underpants in place. I glanced out my window, feeling his eyes on me. But Brody just sat calmly on his bed, reading what looked like a Harry Potter book. I knew he was watching me, though. Well. At the last split second before I dropped the cord, his eyes leapt from the pages to meet mine. Playing with the frayed ends of my old childhood blanket—yes, I still had it on my bed. Jeez, it wasn't like I sucked my thumb still— I thought about me and Brody. Brody and me. When I was six, Mrs. Riesman moved to an Elderly Housing Community (PC for "Old Folks' Home) and in moved the Hansens. Brody's about her age, I think? He's around here somewhere—Brody! It wasn't who we about who we were, it was about who we'd been. Obnoxious little munchkins with no respect for anything, let alone each other. After that, we'd talked very little. The schools we'd gone to since then had been big, and I'd rarely had him in any of my classes. Even though we were next-door-neighbors, we had never tried to get to know each other. I mean, at block parties and stuff we'd crash in his living room, and he'd whip my butt at all his assorted video games. He never drank much, but it was evidently enough to make him forget about Felicia McAdams. Not that it would take much to do that— as I'd said, we weren't exactly friends. Just sort of… there. He was there, I was there. It was early November; she was fifteen, I'd just turned sixteen. I guess she didn't realize that her blinds were up, or maybe she just didn't care. Whatever the case, she walked into her bedroom with nothing but a long T-shit on. It's not like I saw anything. She slid on a black bra and struggled with the catch for a moment before it hooked. She looked half-shocked, half-flattered. She didn't even look mad. Her dark hair looked wet, and I thought for a bit about how she'd probably just been in the shower. Green or blue? Definitely green. That's it, Brody, keep it cool. I wasn't even supposed to like her. I did. I figured by now it was a show, because if she didn't know I was watching, she was an idiot. And Felicia was not an idiot; she wasn't, you know, top-of-the-class student-body-president resident-virgin (was she a virgin? ) or anything, but she was smart. She made decent grades, and she baked cookies all the time. Too much. You'd think she'd get tired of them eventually. On top of all this, she was really, really bad at video games. Like, chronically bad. Sorry, one-track mind, here. I wasn't positive back then, though. It really was hard to tell, you know? She had a serious boyfriend: Liam O'Malley. She'd been dating him for a long time—since the end of tenth grade, I think. They'd broken up and gotten back together several times—I didn't know how many. So why get together again, only to have the same problems arise? I supposed it just came down to emotion: Felicia and Liam just couldn't stay away from each other. Where you care so much that you don't care about anything else. My friend Nick said I was being a girl about it, going on about relationships all the time. Then he got all serious about it, saying I probably wanted a relationship so bad because my parents' relationship sucked. Or it used to suck, before it ended. The end was the best part, I think. When mom stopped crying and started healing. He turned eighteen two weeks before I did. Well, almost never. Felicia never mentioned it, but I knew she remembered the day it happened, too. Not that I was going to talk about it, because I wasn't. I didn't talk much about anything; I liked reading better. Nick did, though. If I was reading at lunch, he'd just sit next to me and tell off our other friends when they tried to get my attention. Not to bring this up again, but I know this for a fact.

I mean, at block parties and stuff we'd crash in his living room, and he'd whip my butt at all his assorted video games. He never drank much, but it was evidently enough to make him forget about Felicia McAdams. Not that it would take much to do that— as I'd said, we weren't exactly friends. Just sort of… there. He was there, I was there. It was early November; she was fifteen, I'd just turned sixteen. I guess she didn't realize that her blinds were up, or maybe she just didn't care. Whatever the case, she walked into her bedroom with nothing but a long T-shit on. It's not like I saw anything. She slid on a black bra and struggled with the catch for a moment before it hooked. She looked half-shocked, half-flattered. She didn't even look mad. Her dark hair looked wet, and I thought for a bit about how she'd probably just been in the shower. Green or blue? Definitely green. That's it, Brody, keep it cool. I wasn't even supposed to like her. I did. I figured by now it was a show, because if she didn't know I was watching, she was an idiot. And Felicia was not an idiot; she wasn't, you know, top-of-the-class student-body-president resident-virgin (was she a virgin? ) or anything, but she was smart. She made decent grades, and she baked cookies all the time. Too much. You'd think she'd get tired of them eventually. On top of all this, she was really, really bad at video games. Like, chronically bad. Sorry, one-track mind, here. I wasn't positive back then, though. It really was hard to tell, you know? She had a serious boyfriend: Liam O'Malley. She'd been dating him for a long time—since the end of tenth grade, I think. They'd broken up and gotten back together several times—I didn't know how many. So why get together again, only to have the same problems arise? I supposed it just came down to emotion: Felicia and Liam just couldn't stay away from each other. Where you care so much that you don't care about anything else. My friend Nick said I was being a girl about it, going on about relationships all the time. Then he got all serious about it, saying I probably wanted a relationship so bad because my parents' relationship sucked. Or it used to suck, before it ended. The end was the best part, I think. When mom stopped crying and started healing. He turned eighteen two weeks before I did. Well, almost never. Felicia never mentioned it, but I knew she remembered the day it happened, too. Not that I was going to talk about it, because I wasn't. I didn't talk much about anything; I liked reading better. Nick did, though. If I was reading at lunch, he'd just sit next to me and tell off our other friends when they tried to get my attention. Not to bring this up again, but I know this for a fact. I sat on the end of my bed for a long time after that, wondering exactly why Felicia and I weren't friends. We should have been. She was always around, and I was always around. I've already got three and a half chapters written besides this. I think I can keep myself in check long enough to finish it. But only if people like it. So, tell me what you think. I've got a basic plan for the plot already, but I'm always open for suggestion. This'll be a big one, guys. Let's see how it works out. They'd never really been friends, but they'd never really been enemies. She likes baking, he likes art, and they'd never really had much to say to each other. Then one day, in sophomore year, Brody sees Felicia changing. And Felicia sees Brody see her changing. And then Felicia does something neither of them expect: she smiles. From then on, they've learned to be what Felicia and Brody like to call  He's there, she's there. They're there, but they're not there together. Being  is a state of indifference, Felicia decides. I hope you'll read it. I undid my jeans and shoved them to my ankles, being careful to leave my underpants in place. I glanced out my window, feeling his eyes on me. But Brody just sat calmly on his bed, reading what looked like a Harry Potter book. I knew he was watching me, though. Well. At the last split second before I dropped the cord, his eyes leapt from the pages to meet mine. Playing with the frayed ends of my old childhood blanket—yes, I still had it on my bed. Jeez, it wasn't like I sucked my thumb still— I thought about me and Brody. Brody and me. When I was six, Mrs. Riesman moved to an Elderly Housing Community (PC for "Old Folks' Home) and in moved the Hansens. Brody's about her age, I think? He's around here somewhere—Brody!

So why get together again, only to have the same problems arise? I supposed it just came down to emotion: Felicia and Liam just couldn't stay away from each other. Where you care so much that you don't care about anything else. My friend Nick said I was being a girl about it, going on about relationships all the time. Then he got all serious about it, saying I probably wanted a relationship so bad because my parents' relationship sucked. Or it used to suck, before it ended. The end was the best part, I think. When mom stopped crying and started healing. He turned eighteen two weeks before I did. Well, almost never. Felicia never mentioned it, but I knew she remembered the day it happened, too. Not that I was going to talk about it, because I wasn't. I didn't talk much about anything; I liked reading better. Nick did, though. If I was reading at lunch, he'd just sit next to me and tell off our other friends when they tried to get my attention. Not to bring this up again, but I know this for a fact. I sat on the end of my bed for a long time after that, wondering exactly why Felicia and I weren't friends. We should have been. She was always around, and I was always around. I've already got three and a half chapters written besides this. I think I can keep myself in check long enough to finish it. But only if people like it. So, tell me what you think. I've got a basic plan for the plot already, but I'm always open for suggestion. This'll be a big one, guys. Let's see how it works out. They'd never really been friends, but they'd never really been enemies. She likes baking, he likes art, and they'd never really had much to say to each other. Then one day, in sophomore year, Brody sees Felicia changing. And Felicia sees Brody see her changing. And then Felicia does something neither of them expect: she smiles. From then on, they've learned to be what Felicia and Brody like to call  He's there, she's there. They're there, but they're not there together. Being  is a state of indifference, Felicia decides. I hope you'll read it. I undid my jeans and shoved them to my ankles, being careful to leave my underpants in place. I glanced out my window, feeling his eyes on me. But Brody just sat calmly on his bed, reading what looked like a Harry Potter book. I knew he was watching me, though. Well. At the last split second before I dropped the cord, his eyes leapt from the pages to meet mine. Playing with the frayed ends of my old childhood blanket—yes, I still had it on my bed. Jeez, it wasn't like I sucked my thumb still— I thought about me and Brody. Brody and me. When I was six, Mrs. Riesman moved to an Elderly Housing Community (PC for "Old Folks' Home) and in moved the Hansens. Brody's about her age, I think? He's around here somewhere—Brody! It wasn't who we about who we were, it was about who we'd been. Obnoxious little munchkins with no respect for anything, let alone each other. After that, we'd talked very little. The schools we'd gone to since then had been big, and I'd rarely had him in any of my classes. Even though we were next-door-neighbors, we had never tried to get to know each other. I mean, at block parties and stuff we'd crash in his living room, and he'd whip my butt at all his assorted video games. He never drank much, but it was evidently enough to make him forget about Felicia McAdams. Not that it would take much to do that— as I'd said, we weren't exactly friends. Just sort of… there. He was there, I was there. It was early November; she was fifteen, I'd just turned sixteen. I guess she didn't realize that her blinds were up, or maybe she just didn't care. Whatever the case, she walked into her bedroom with nothing but a long T-shit on. It's not like I saw anything. She slid on a black bra and struggled with the catch for a moment before it hooked. She looked half-shocked, half-flattered. She didn't even look mad. Her dark hair looked wet, and I thought for a bit about how she'd probably just been in the shower. Green or blue? Definitely green. That's it, Brody, keep it cool. I wasn't even supposed to like her. I did. I figured by now it was a show, because if she didn't know I was watching, she was an idiot. And Felicia was not an idiot; she wasn't, you know, top-of-the-class student-body-president resident-virgin (was she a virgin? ) or anything, but she was smart. She made decent grades, and she baked cookies all the time. Too much. You'd think she'd get tired of them eventually. On top of all this, she was really, really bad at video games.

The fields sparkled as dew drops on the grass reflected the sunlight, shimmering. Even though I lived in outback New South Wales, we were surprisingly lucky with our rainfall. I headed over to him, admiring the powerful strides of the young horse. It got me out of sitting around in the house all day, watching bad TV show marathons and moaning about not having a job yet. The mare's show name was Freckled Martyr's Little Gypsy, so I'm sure you understand why I just call her Gypsy. She was a beautiful dapple-grey mare with a calm temperament. Jip was brown while Pete was black, but other than the colour they were identical. Thus the name. It usually took over an hour to get there on horseback, and only twenty minutes on the quad bike. Even though it would've been much quicker to just get the quad out, I preferred riding Gypsy. If even one of them decided to turn and run, the rest would soon follow. They were extremely stupid. Can you tell I can't stand the animal? I sprinkled some more water on my neck and wrists, to cool myself down further. Luckily, it was shallow, but I'd still managed to wet my whole lower body. He looked meticulously groomed in jeans and a t-shirt, so he couldn't be some homeless weirdo that had somehow managed to wander out to the middle of nowhere. But seriously, there were no creases at all. We didn't have many neighbours – only two – and I knew basically all their relatives by sight. But hell yeah he was stunning. No, beautiful would be more fitting a word. Hold up, wasn't his face just a mask? He wanted to help me out of the river. Like hell I was going to accept that hand! I gingerly hopped to the shore, ignoring the shaking of my hands and always keeping an eye on him. I started backing away from him, ringing out my shirt as much as possible and not even bothering with my jeans. Not to mention the pristine clothes. I don't consider myself a very temperamental person; I think I wasted a majority of my anger when I was little. I glanced at his face and saw his eyes go completely white. I blinked and looked again, but they were that lovely amber colour again. I shook my head. Must've been a trick of the light. It didn't touch his palm, just hovered there. As I stared at it, it began to change colours, turning every colour of the rainbow. What could I make him do that would show he didn't have magic? Ha! I'd like to see him get out of this one. If you don't understand anything that's happening/the slang, feel free to ask! I'm generally very prompt with replies. I would really appreciate it if you didn't mind giving me some feedback about it – if you like the changes or not, and what else you think could still be improved upon. As in, the horse goes from white, to grey, to black. Earth has become a lot more modernized (from the 14th century to the 21st).

The fields sparkled as dew drops on the grass reflected the sunlight, shimmering. Even though I lived in outback New South Wales, we were surprisingly lucky with our rainfall. I headed over to him, admiring the powerful strides of the young horse. It got me out of sitting around in the house all day, watching bad TV show marathons and moaning about not having a job yet. The mare's show name was Freckled Martyr's Little Gypsy, so I'm sure you understand why I just call her Gypsy. She was a beautiful dapple-grey mare with a calm temperament. Jip was brown while Pete was black, but other than the colour they were identical. Thus the name. It usually took over an hour to get there on horseback, and only twenty minutes on the quad bike. Even though it would've been much quicker to just get the quad out, I preferred riding Gypsy. If even one of them decided to turn and run, the rest would soon follow. They were extremely stupid. Can you tell I can't stand the animal? I sprinkled some more water on my neck and wrists, to cool myself down further. Luckily, it was shallow, but I'd still managed to wet my whole lower body. He looked meticulously groomed in jeans and a t-shirt, so he couldn't be some homeless weirdo that had somehow managed to wander out to the middle of nowhere. But seriously, there were no creases at all. We didn't have many neighbours – only two – and I knew basically all their relatives by sight. But hell yeah he was stunning. No, beautiful would be more fitting a word. Hold up, wasn't his face just a mask? He wanted to help me out of the river. Like hell I was going to accept that hand! I gingerly hopped to the shore, ignoring the shaking of my hands and always keeping an eye on him. I started backing away from him, ringing out my shirt as much as possible and not even bothering with my jeans. Not to mention the pristine clothes. I don't consider myself a very temperamental person; I think I wasted a majority of my anger when I was little. I glanced at his face and saw his eyes go completely white. I blinked and looked again, but they were that lovely amber colour again. I shook my head. Must've been a trick of the light. It didn't touch his palm, just hovered there. As I stared at it, it began to change colours, turning every colour of the rainbow. What could I make him do that would show he didn't have magic? Ha! I'd like to see him get out of this one. If you don't understand anything that's happening/the slang, feel free to ask! I'm generally very prompt with replies.

As I stared at it, it began to change colours, turning every colour of the rainbow. What could I make him do that would show he didn't have magic? Ha! I'd like to see him get out of this one. If you don't understand anything that's happening/the slang, feel free to ask! I'm generally very prompt with replies. I would really appreciate it if you didn't mind giving me some feedback about it – if you like the changes or not, and what else you think could still be improved upon.

I headed over to him, admiring the powerful strides of the young horse. It got me out of sitting around in the house all day, watching bad TV show marathons and moaning about not having a job yet. The mare's show name was Freckled Martyr's Little Gypsy, so I'm sure you understand why I just call her Gypsy. She was a beautiful dapple-grey mare with a calm temperament. Jip was brown while Pete was black, but other than the colour they were identical. Thus the name. It usually took over an hour to get there on horseback, and only twenty minutes on the quad bike. Even though it would've been much quicker to just get the quad out, I preferred riding Gypsy. If even one of them decided to turn and run, the rest would soon follow. They were extremely stupid. Can you tell I can't stand the animal? I sprinkled some more water on my neck and wrists, to cool myself down further. Luckily, it was shallow, but I'd still managed to wet my whole lower body. He looked meticulously groomed in jeans and a t-shirt, so he couldn't be some homeless weirdo that had somehow managed to wander out to the middle of nowhere. But seriously, there were no creases at all. We didn't have many neighbours – only two – and I knew basically all their relatives by sight. But hell yeah he was stunning. No, beautiful would be more fitting a word. Hold up, wasn't his face just a mask? He wanted to help me out of the river. Like hell I was going to accept that hand! I gingerly hopped to the shore, ignoring the shaking of my hands and always keeping an eye on him. I started backing away from him, ringing out my shirt as much as possible and not even bothering with my jeans. Not to mention the pristine clothes.

He thought I would blow it off as long as he gave me a puppy-dog look and said  His friends even encouraged it. Incredibly angry. Ryan wasn't wrong to label me meek. We've been dating for over a year and a half and I've never dared to raise my voice at him. When he forgot my birthday I laughed. When he took Carrie, my younger sister, to a Josh Groban concert, even though he's my favorite musical artist in the world, I told him she really deserved it. And I did. Okay, it's a lot disgusting. But I'm not the most confident girl in the world. Ryan is the only boyfriend I've ever had, and I'll be turning twenty in a few months. We only hooked up because I was in need of a date to senior homecoming and my best friend paid Ryan to take me. He needed the cash and thought I was  and it might be worth it. I wasn't so surprised to find out she had sex. And at first it worked. When he quickly kissed me on the lips and said,  and ran off to football practice I silenced my aching heart. I asked her who he was and she gave me that angelic smile of hers and said,  I wanted to tell her that Ryan had told me what happened between them but I'm too timid to even get mad at my little sister. Granted, she technically is taller than me, standing at an average 5'6, but still. I kept replaying the signs that Ryan was into Carrie through my mind. How could I have not noticed? Then I realized that it wouldn't have mattered. I would have let it go on even if I had known. I finally fell asleep at four AM, only to have to wake up three hours later for my Ancient Greek Literature class. Ryan and I always sat next to each other. Of course I looked horrible. I had three hours of sleep! I woke up with the hugest dark circles under my dull grey eyes, which are usually a bright and perky blue, and no matter how hard I tried my auburn hair just looked mousy brown. And you cheated on me! My mind began to whirl. That's a fake smile. He does that when he's walking all over you. On Thursdays I only had one class and he had three so we always split up. I headed back to the parking lot, surprised at my feisty thoughts. I swear. My mind was under a lot of stress and I was doing things out of character. I fully intended to pat his car with my hand, draw a heart in the dust on his window, then go back home. I began to walk away but I turned back around. Ryan's words kept running through my mind and I couldn't shake them. I could only imagine what he would say. I'd get yelled out, for sure, and probably dumped. And I couldn't have that. But the man standing in front of me was not someone I was particularly thrilled to see. It took me a minute to place who he was, but he had this I-could-care-less look that sparked my memory. I recognized him quickly, anyone who went to my high school would. He hadn't changed too drastically since then. He was still incredibly tall with the same shaggy brown hair, but he had shaved his beard that made him look ten years older. I think it was the same car he drove back at Ridgemont High. He pulled out a pack of cigarettes from his back jean pocket and hit the end against the side of his arm. I was praying to God that he wouldn't recognize me. I knew exactly what he was talking about. Peter, or  as all his friends called him, was known for being a trouble-maker. He was constantly picking fights with anyone who was willing to defend themselves. Word has it that he went to anger management three times and it never worked. I also heard he drank and did drugs. His grip was comfortable. I hadn't known he got arrested. I was surprised when he jogged up to me and blocked my path. I had to look up to view his face, he was incredibly tall. He came awfully close to touching me and I blanched. We had been sitting at the coffee shop for twenty minutes and I still hadn't said a word about Ryan. Peter kept trying to get me to talk but I remained mum. I really did want to tell someone, anyone, but I couldn't bring myself to admit it. The whole situation was really embarrassing. What could it really hurt? It's not like he could judge me. His knuckles, unlike mine, were pure white. It took me a moment to realize they were scarred. That's what my mother and best friend do. Peter squeezed my hand gently, then pulled me back. He patted to the seat next to him and I sat down. I wasn't shocked to hear this, he didn't strike me as gay. But it was odd. Guys don't usually point this out to me, especially after complimenting on me. Or was he hitting on me? Tell him that he better think twice before double-crossing you. Then give him back anything of yours he gave you, go home and slap your sister, then buy yourself something as congratulations for standing up for yourself. I was a little disappointed, although I'm not sure why. I wasn't bawling. I've never been much of a crier. But a few tears were rolling down my cheek, slow and steady. From Peter. From the delinquent in high school. He was standing outside the coffee shop, walking next to a pretty girl. He slipped his hand into the back of her jean pocket and she slapped it away. He smiled at her playfully, a smile that he gave to me. Ryan slung his arm around her shoulder and she rested her head on his. Yes I did. In fact, for a very long time I thought I was them. That used to be me. The girl who Ryan would smile and tease and flirt with. We'd go on movie dates and stay up late into the night making out in the back of his car. The guy that I actually gave my virginity to, even though I didn't want to. And in the span of two days he suddenly became a creep. A jerk. A guy that girls are told to stay away from. Without giving him an answer I stood up, gathered my books from the chair, and left the coffee shop. Ryan was too far away to notice me but I was glad. I made my way back to the parking lot, Peter trailing behind me. He began to talk about how he was sorry for whatever he said and he didn't mean it. I ignored him. I didn't bother to check if Ryan could see me, or if there was a security guard. For once in my life I was enraged. And I wanted revenge. With a loud crash the bat hit the front of his windshield. It cracked, sending glass splinters in every direction. I hit the windshield a few more times until it was ruined. I moved onto the sides of the car, making dents everywhere I went. I swung the bat so hard into the side mirrors that they flung off. Reaching into my purse I dug out a pale pink lipstick. This wouldn't do. A girl was standing a few feet away, her mouth wide open. I yelled to her,  She nodded and reached into her pocket and tossed me the lipstick. It was daring. It was crazy. In a low voice he said,  He placed his hands on my hips, pulling me close. Perhaps it was the butterflies from before, or maybe I was still flying high from the adrenaline, but I reached my hand to grab Peter's neck and I pulled him down. My first-ever movie kiss. Peter had perfect lips and was a great kisser and obviously into kissing me just as much I was into kissing him. He slid his arms down my waist, down to my thighs where he pulled me up and placed me on Ryan's broken car. One of his hands ran through my hair and the other he ran down my arm. I covered his mouth with my hand and turned to the sound of the voice. His voice raised several pitches and he was completely horrified. The girl he was with from before was trailing behind, her mouth hanging open in an unflattering way. I thought that I must look a trillion times better than she did, what with my lips red from kissing Peter. Ryan always said I looked the best after he kissed me, and he was only an okay kisser. He turned to his new girl toy and muttered,  Candy was staring at him Peter, checking him out from head to toe with a coy smile on her face. When he was out of site Peter turned to me with a grin. My heart rate began to speed up and I began to blabber about how stupid I was and what I just did. I was whirling my hands around so much, raising them to the heavens to curse God for making me so stupid and Peter grabbed them with his hands. AN: This is just kind of a silly, hopefully cute, one-shot that I felt like writing. It's not meant to be anything too amazing. I wanted to try to stay in the 5,000 word area. I forget what inspired me to write this, but I wrote it all in one sitting. This is the first time I've written in this point of view. He thought I would blow it off as long as he gave me a puppy-dog look and said  His friends even encouraged it. Incredibly angry. Ryan wasn't wrong to label me meek. We've been dating for over a year and a half and I've never dared to raise my voice at him. When he forgot my birthday I laughed. When he took Carrie, my younger sister, to a Josh Groban concert, even though he's my favorite musical artist in the world, I told him she really deserved it. And I did. Okay, it's a lot disgusting. But I'm not the most confident girl in the world. Ryan is the only boyfriend I've ever had, and I'll be turning twenty in a few months. We only hooked up because I was in need of a date to senior homecoming and my best friend paid Ryan to take me. He needed the cash and thought I was  and it might be worth it. I wasn't so surprised to find out she had sex. And at first it worked. When he quickly kissed me on the lips and said,  and ran off to football practice I silenced my aching heart. I asked her who he was and she gave me that angelic smile of hers and said,  I wanted to tell her that Ryan had told me what happened between them but I'm too timid to even get mad at my little sister.

When he took Carrie, my younger sister, to a Josh Groban concert, even though he's my favorite musical artist in the world, I told him she really deserved it. And I did. Okay, it's a lot disgusting. But I'm not the most confident girl in the world. Ryan is the only boyfriend I've ever had, and I'll be turning twenty in a few months. We only hooked up because I was in need of a date to senior homecoming and my best friend paid Ryan to take me. He needed the cash and thought I was  and it might be worth it. I wasn't so surprised to find out she had sex. And at first it worked. When he quickly kissed me on the lips and said,  and ran off to football practice I silenced my aching heart. I asked her who he was and she gave me that angelic smile of hers and said,  I wanted to tell her that Ryan had told me what happened between them but I'm too timid to even get mad at my little sister. Granted, she technically is taller than me, standing at an average 5'6, but still. I kept replaying the signs that Ryan was into Carrie through my mind. How could I have not noticed? Then I realized that it wouldn't have mattered. I would have let it go on even if I had known. I finally fell asleep at four AM, only to have to wake up three hours later for my Ancient Greek Literature class. Ryan and I always sat next to each other. Of course I looked horrible. I had three hours of sleep! I woke up with the hugest dark circles under my dull grey eyes, which are usually a bright and perky blue, and no matter how hard I tried my auburn hair just looked mousy brown. And you cheated on me! My mind began to whirl. That's a fake smile. He does that when he's walking all over you. On Thursdays I only had one class and he had three so we always split up. I headed back to the parking lot, surprised at my feisty thoughts. I swear. My mind was under a lot of stress and I was doing things out of character. I fully intended to pat his car with my hand, draw a heart in the dust on his window, then go back home. I began to walk away but I turned back around. Ryan's words kept running through my mind and I couldn't shake them. I could only imagine what he would say. I'd get yelled out, for sure, and probably dumped. And I couldn't have that. But the man standing in front of me was not someone I was particularly thrilled to see. It took me a minute to place who he was, but he had this I-could-care-less look that sparked my memory. I recognized him quickly, anyone who went to my high school would. He hadn't changed too drastically since then. He was still incredibly tall with the same shaggy brown hair, but he had shaved his beard that made him look ten years older. I think it was the same car he drove back at Ridgemont High. He pulled out a pack of cigarettes from his back jean pocket and hit the end against the side of his arm. I was praying to God that he wouldn't recognize me. I knew exactly what he was talking about. Peter, or  as all his friends called him, was known for being a trouble-maker. He was constantly picking fights with anyone who was willing to defend themselves. Word has it that he went to anger management three times and it never worked. I also heard he drank and did drugs. His grip was comfortable. I hadn't known he got arrested. I was surprised when he jogged up to me and blocked my path. I had to look up to view his face, he was incredibly tall. He came awfully close to touching me and I blanched. We had been sitting at the coffee shop for twenty minutes and I still hadn't said a word about Ryan. Peter kept trying to get me to talk but I remained mum. I really did want to tell someone, anyone, but I couldn't bring myself to admit it. The whole situation was really embarrassing. What could it really hurt? It's not like he could judge me. His knuckles, unlike mine, were pure white. It took me a moment to realize they were scarred. That's what my mother and best friend do. Peter squeezed my hand gently, then pulled me back. He patted to the seat next to him and I sat down. I wasn't shocked to hear this, he didn't strike me as gay. But it was odd. Guys don't usually point this out to me, especially after complimenting on me. Or was he hitting on me? Tell him that he better think twice before double-crossing you. Then give him back anything of yours he gave you, go home and slap your sister, then buy yourself something as congratulations for standing up for yourself. I was a little disappointed, although I'm not sure why. I wasn't bawling. I've never been much of a crier. But a few tears were rolling down my cheek, slow and steady. From Peter. From the delinquent in high school. He was standing outside the coffee shop, walking next to a pretty girl. He slipped his hand into the back of her jean pocket and she slapped it away. He smiled at her playfully, a smile that he gave to me. Ryan slung his arm around her shoulder and she rested her head on his. Yes I did. In fact, for a very long time I thought I was them. That used to be me. The girl who Ryan would smile and tease and flirt with. We'd go on movie dates and stay up late into the night making out in the back of his car. The guy that I actually gave my virginity to, even though I didn't want to. And in the span of two days he suddenly became a creep. A jerk. A guy that girls are told to stay away from. Without giving him an answer I stood up, gathered my books from the chair, and left the coffee shop. Ryan was too far away to notice me but I was glad. I made my way back to the parking lot, Peter trailing behind me. He began to talk about how he was sorry for whatever he said and he didn't mean it. I ignored him. I didn't bother to check if Ryan could see me, or if there was a security guard. For once in my life I was enraged. And I wanted revenge. With a loud crash the bat hit the front of his windshield. It cracked, sending glass splinters in every direction. I hit the windshield a few more times until it was ruined. I moved onto the sides of the car, making dents everywhere I went. I swung the bat so hard into the side mirrors that they flung off. Reaching into my purse I dug out a pale pink lipstick. This wouldn't do. A girl was standing a few feet away, her mouth wide open. I yelled to her,  She nodded and reached into her pocket and tossed me the lipstick. It was daring. It was crazy. In a low voice he said,  He placed his hands on my hips, pulling me close. Perhaps it was the butterflies from before, or maybe I was still flying high from the adrenaline, but I reached my hand to grab Peter's neck and I pulled him down. My first-ever movie kiss. Peter had perfect lips and was a great kisser and obviously into kissing me just as much I was into kissing him. He slid his arms down my waist, down to my thighs where he pulled me up and placed me on Ryan's broken car. One of his hands ran through my hair and the other he ran down my arm. I covered his mouth with my hand and turned to the sound of the voice. His voice raised several pitches and he was completely horrified. The girl he was with from before was trailing behind, her mouth hanging open in an unflattering way. I thought that I must look a trillion times better than she did, what with my lips red from kissing Peter. Ryan always said I looked the best after he kissed me, and he was only an okay kisser. He turned to his new girl toy and muttered,  Candy was staring at him Peter, checking him out from head to toe with a coy smile on her face. When he was out of site Peter turned to me with a grin. My heart rate began to speed up and I began to blabber about how stupid I was and what I just did. I was whirling my hands around so much, raising them to the heavens to curse God for making me so stupid and Peter grabbed them with his hands. AN: This is just kind of a silly, hopefully cute, one-shot that I felt like writing. It's not meant to be anything too amazing. I wanted to try to stay in the 5,000 word area.

My heart rate began to speed up and I began to blabber about how stupid I was and what I just did. I was whirling my hands around so much, raising them to the heavens to curse God for making me so stupid and Peter grabbed them with his hands. AN: This is just kind of a silly, hopefully cute, one-shot that I felt like writing. It's not meant to be anything too amazing. I wanted to try to stay in the 5,000 word area. I forget what inspired me to write this, but I wrote it all in one sitting. This is the first time I've written in this point of view. He thought I would blow it off as long as he gave me a puppy-dog look and said  His friends even encouraged it. Incredibly angry. Ryan wasn't wrong to label me meek. We've been dating for over a year and a half and I've never dared to raise my voice at him. When he forgot my birthday I laughed. When he took Carrie, my younger sister, to a Josh Groban concert, even though he's my favorite musical artist in the world, I told him she really deserved it. And I did. Okay, it's a lot disgusting. But I'm not the most confident girl in the world. Ryan is the only boyfriend I've ever had, and I'll be turning twenty in a few months. We only hooked up because I was in need of a date to senior homecoming and my best friend paid Ryan to take me. He needed the cash and thought I was  and it might be worth it. I wasn't so surprised to find out she had sex. And at first it worked. When he quickly kissed me on the lips and said,  and ran off to football practice I silenced my aching heart. I asked her who he was and she gave me that angelic smile of hers and said,  I wanted to tell her that Ryan had told me what happened between them but I'm too timid to even get mad at my little sister. Granted, she technically is taller than me, standing at an average 5'6, but still. I kept replaying the signs that Ryan was into Carrie through my mind. How could I have not noticed? Then I realized that it wouldn't have mattered. I would have let it go on even if I had known. I finally fell asleep at four AM, only to have to wake up three hours later for my Ancient Greek Literature class. Ryan and I always sat next to each other. Of course I looked horrible. I had three hours of sleep! I woke up with the hugest dark circles under my dull grey eyes, which are usually a bright and perky blue, and no matter how hard I tried my auburn hair just looked mousy brown. And you cheated on me! My mind began to whirl. That's a fake smile. He does that when he's walking all over you. On Thursdays I only had one class and he had three so we always split up. I headed back to the parking lot, surprised at my feisty thoughts. I swear. My mind was under a lot of stress and I was doing things out of character. I fully intended to pat his car with my hand, draw a heart in the dust on his window, then go back home. I began to walk away but I turned back around. Ryan's words kept running through my mind and I couldn't shake them. I could only imagine what he would say. I'd get yelled out, for sure, and probably dumped. And I couldn't have that. But the man standing in front of me was not someone I was particularly thrilled to see. It took me a minute to place who he was, but he had this I-could-care-less look that sparked my memory. I recognized him quickly, anyone who went to my high school would. He hadn't changed too drastically since then. He was still incredibly tall with the same shaggy brown hair, but he had shaved his beard that made him look ten years older. I think it was the same car he drove back at Ridgemont High. He pulled out a pack of cigarettes from his back jean pocket and hit the end against the side of his arm. I was praying to God that he wouldn't recognize me. I knew exactly what he was talking about. Peter, or  as all his friends called him, was known for being a trouble-maker. He was constantly picking fights with anyone who was willing to defend themselves. Word has it that he went to anger management three times and it never worked. I also heard he drank and did drugs. His grip was comfortable. I hadn't known he got arrested. I was surprised when he jogged up to me and blocked my path. I had to look up to view his face, he was incredibly tall. He came awfully close to touching me and I blanched. We had been sitting at the coffee shop for twenty minutes and I still hadn't said a word about Ryan. Peter kept trying to get me to talk but I remained mum. I really did want to tell someone, anyone, but I couldn't bring myself to admit it. The whole situation was really embarrassing. What could it really hurt? It's not like he could judge me. His knuckles, unlike mine, were pure white. It took me a moment to realize they were scarred. That's what my mother and best friend do. Peter squeezed my hand gently, then pulled me back. He patted to the seat next to him and I sat down. I wasn't shocked to hear this, he didn't strike me as gay. But it was odd. Guys don't usually point this out to me, especially after complimenting on me. Or was he hitting on me? Tell him that he better think twice before double-crossing you. Then give him back anything of yours he gave you, go home and slap your sister, then buy yourself something as congratulations for standing up for yourself. I was a little disappointed, although I'm not sure why. I wasn't bawling. I've never been much of a crier. But a few tears were rolling down my cheek, slow and steady. From Peter. From the delinquent in high school. He was standing outside the coffee shop, walking next to a pretty girl. He slipped his hand into the back of her jean pocket and she slapped it away. He smiled at her playfully, a smile that he gave to me. Ryan slung his arm around her shoulder and she rested her head on his. Yes I did. In fact, for a very long time I thought I was them. That used to be me. The girl who Ryan would smile and tease and flirt with. We'd go on movie dates and stay up late into the night making out in the back of his car. The guy that I actually gave my virginity to, even though I didn't want to. And in the span of two days he suddenly became a creep. A jerk. A guy that girls are told to stay away from. Without giving him an answer I stood up, gathered my books from the chair, and left the coffee shop. Ryan was too far away to notice me but I was glad. I made my way back to the parking lot, Peter trailing behind me. He began to talk about how he was sorry for whatever he said and he didn't mean it. I ignored him. I didn't bother to check if Ryan could see me, or if there was a security guard. For once in my life I was enraged. And I wanted revenge. With a loud crash the bat hit the front of his windshield. It cracked, sending glass splinters in every direction. I hit the windshield a few more times until it was ruined. I moved onto the sides of the car, making dents everywhere I went. I swung the bat so hard into the side mirrors that they flung off. Reaching into my purse I dug out a pale pink lipstick. This wouldn't do. A girl was standing a few feet away, her mouth wide open. I yelled to her,  She nodded and reached into her pocket and tossed me the lipstick. It was daring. It was crazy. In a low voice he said,  He placed his hands on my hips, pulling me close. Perhaps it was the butterflies from before, or maybe I was still flying high from the adrenaline, but I reached my hand to grab Peter's neck and I pulled him down. My first-ever movie kiss. Peter had perfect lips and was a great kisser and obviously into kissing me just as much I was into kissing him. He slid his arms down my waist, down to my thighs where he pulled me up and placed me on Ryan's broken car. One of his hands ran through my hair and the other he ran down my arm. I covered his mouth with my hand and turned to the sound of the voice. His voice raised several pitches and he was completely horrified. The girl he was with from before was trailing behind, her mouth hanging open in an unflattering way. I thought that I must look a trillion times better than she did, what with my lips red from kissing Peter. Ryan always said I looked the best after he kissed me, and he was only an okay kisser. He turned to his new girl toy and muttered,  Candy was staring at him Peter, checking him out from head to toe with a coy smile on her face. When he was out of site Peter turned to me with a grin.

Perhaps it was the butterflies from before, or maybe I was still flying high from the adrenaline, but I reached my hand to grab Peter's neck and I pulled him down. My first-ever movie kiss. Peter had perfect lips and was a great kisser and obviously into kissing me just as much I was into kissing him. He slid his arms down my waist, down to my thighs where he pulled me up and placed me on Ryan's broken car. One of his hands ran through my hair and the other he ran down my arm. I covered his mouth with my hand and turned to the sound of the voice. His voice raised several pitches and he was completely horrified. The girl he was with from before was trailing behind, her mouth hanging open in an unflattering way. I thought that I must look a trillion times better than she did, what with my lips red from kissing Peter. Ryan always said I looked the best after he kissed me, and he was only an okay kisser. He turned to his new girl toy and muttered,  Candy was staring at him Peter, checking him out from head to toe with a coy smile on her face. When he was out of site Peter turned to me with a grin. My heart rate began to speed up and I began to blabber about how stupid I was and what I just did. I was whirling my hands around so much, raising them to the heavens to curse God for making me so stupid and Peter grabbed them with his hands. AN: This is just kind of a silly, hopefully cute, one-shot that I felt like writing. It's not meant to be anything too amazing. I wanted to try to stay in the 5,000 word area. I forget what inspired me to write this, but I wrote it all in one sitting. This is the first time I've written in this point of view. He thought I would blow it off as long as he gave me a puppy-dog look and said  His friends even encouraged it. Incredibly angry. Ryan wasn't wrong to label me meek. We've been dating for over a year and a half and I've never dared to raise my voice at him. When he forgot my birthday I laughed. When he took Carrie, my younger sister, to a Josh Groban concert, even though he's my favorite musical artist in the world, I told him she really deserved it. And I did. Okay, it's a lot disgusting. But I'm not the most confident girl in the world. Ryan is the only boyfriend I've ever had, and I'll be turning twenty in a few months. We only hooked up because I was in need of a date to senior homecoming and my best friend paid Ryan to take me. He needed the cash and thought I was  and it might be worth it. I wasn't so surprised to find out she had sex. And at first it worked. When he quickly kissed me on the lips and said,  and ran off to football practice I silenced my aching heart. I asked her who he was and she gave me that angelic smile of hers and said,  I wanted to tell her that Ryan had told me what happened between them but I'm too timid to even get mad at my little sister. Granted, she technically is taller than me, standing at an average 5'6, but still. I kept replaying the signs that Ryan was into Carrie through my mind. How could I have not noticed? Then I realized that it wouldn't have mattered. I would have let it go on even if I had known. I finally fell asleep at four AM, only to have to wake up three hours later for my Ancient Greek Literature class. Ryan and I always sat next to each other. Of course I looked horrible. I had three hours of sleep! I woke up with the hugest dark circles under my dull grey eyes, which are usually a bright and perky blue, and no matter how hard I tried my auburn hair just looked mousy brown. And you cheated on me! My mind began to whirl. That's a fake smile. He does that when he's walking all over you. On Thursdays I only had one class and he had three so we always split up. I headed back to the parking lot, surprised at my feisty thoughts. I swear. My mind was under a lot of stress and I was doing things out of character. I fully intended to pat his car with my hand, draw a heart in the dust on his window, then go back home. I began to walk away but I turned back around. Ryan's words kept running through my mind and I couldn't shake them. I could only imagine what he would say. I'd get yelled out, for sure, and probably dumped. And I couldn't have that. But the man standing in front of me was not someone I was particularly thrilled to see. It took me a minute to place who he was, but he had this I-could-care-less look that sparked my memory. I recognized him quickly, anyone who went to my high school would. He hadn't changed too drastically since then. He was still incredibly tall with the same shaggy brown hair, but he had shaved his beard that made him look ten years older. I think it was the same car he drove back at Ridgemont High. He pulled out a pack of cigarettes from his back jean pocket and hit the end against the side of his arm. I was praying to God that he wouldn't recognize me. I knew exactly what he was talking about. Peter, or  as all his friends called him, was known for being a trouble-maker. He was constantly picking fights with anyone who was willing to defend themselves. Word has it that he went to anger management three times and it never worked. I also heard he drank and did drugs. His grip was comfortable. I hadn't known he got arrested. I was surprised when he jogged up to me and blocked my path. I had to look up to view his face, he was incredibly tall. He came awfully close to touching me and I blanched. We had been sitting at the coffee shop for twenty minutes and I still hadn't said a word about Ryan. Peter kept trying to get me to talk but I remained mum. I really did want to tell someone, anyone, but I couldn't bring myself to admit it. The whole situation was really embarrassing. What could it really hurt? It's not like he could judge me. His knuckles, unlike mine, were pure white. It took me a moment to realize they were scarred. That's what my mother and best friend do. Peter squeezed my hand gently, then pulled me back. He patted to the seat next to him and I sat down. I wasn't shocked to hear this, he didn't strike me as gay. But it was odd. Guys don't usually point this out to me, especially after complimenting on me. Or was he hitting on me? Tell him that he better think twice before double-crossing you. Then give him back anything of yours he gave you, go home and slap your sister, then buy yourself something as congratulations for standing up for yourself. I was a little disappointed, although I'm not sure why. I wasn't bawling. I've never been much of a crier. But a few tears were rolling down my cheek, slow and steady. From Peter. From the delinquent in high school. He was standing outside the coffee shop, walking next to a pretty girl. He slipped his hand into the back of her jean pocket and she slapped it away. He smiled at her playfully, a smile that he gave to me. Ryan slung his arm around her shoulder and she rested her head on his. Yes I did. In fact, for a very long time I thought I was them. That used to be me. The girl who Ryan would smile and tease and flirt with. We'd go on movie dates and stay up late into the night making out in the back of his car. The guy that I actually gave my virginity to, even though I didn't want to. And in the span of two days he suddenly became a creep. A jerk. A guy that girls are told to stay away from. Without giving him an answer I stood up, gathered my books from the chair, and left the coffee shop. Ryan was too far away to notice me but I was glad. I made my way back to the parking lot, Peter trailing behind me. He began to talk about how he was sorry for whatever he said and he didn't mean it. I ignored him. I didn't bother to check if Ryan could see me, or if there was a security guard. For once in my life I was enraged. And I wanted revenge. With a loud crash the bat hit the front of his windshield. It cracked, sending glass splinters in every direction. I hit the windshield a few more times until it was ruined. I moved onto the sides of the car, making dents everywhere I went. I swung the bat so hard into the side mirrors that they flung off. Reaching into my purse I dug out a pale pink lipstick. This wouldn't do. A girl was standing a few feet away, her mouth wide open.

Without giving him an answer I stood up, gathered my books from the chair, and left the coffee shop. Ryan was too far away to notice me but I was glad. I made my way back to the parking lot, Peter trailing behind me. He began to talk about how he was sorry for whatever he said and he didn't mean it. I ignored him. I didn't bother to check if Ryan could see me, or if there was a security guard. For once in my life I was enraged. And I wanted revenge. With a loud crash the bat hit the front of his windshield. It cracked, sending glass splinters in every direction. I hit the windshield a few more times until it was ruined. I moved onto the sides of the car, making dents everywhere I went. I swung the bat so hard into the side mirrors that they flung off. Reaching into my purse I dug out a pale pink lipstick. This wouldn't do. A girl was standing a few feet away, her mouth wide open. I yelled to her,  She nodded and reached into her pocket and tossed me the lipstick. It was daring. It was crazy. In a low voice he said,  He placed his hands on my hips, pulling me close. Perhaps it was the butterflies from before, or maybe I was still flying high from the adrenaline, but I reached my hand to grab Peter's neck and I pulled him down. My first-ever movie kiss. Peter had perfect lips and was a great kisser and obviously into kissing me just as much I was into kissing him. He slid his arms down my waist, down to my thighs where he pulled me up and placed me on Ryan's broken car. One of his hands ran through my hair and the other he ran down my arm. I covered his mouth with my hand and turned to the sound of the voice. His voice raised several pitches and he was completely horrified. The girl he was with from before was trailing behind, her mouth hanging open in an unflattering way. I thought that I must look a trillion times better than she did, what with my lips red from kissing Peter. Ryan always said I looked the best after he kissed me, and he was only an okay kisser. He turned to his new girl toy and muttered,  Candy was staring at him Peter, checking him out from head to toe with a coy smile on her face. When he was out of site Peter turned to me with a grin. My heart rate began to speed up and I began to blabber about how stupid I was and what I just did. I was whirling my hands around so much, raising them to the heavens to curse God for making me so stupid and Peter grabbed them with his hands. AN: This is just kind of a silly, hopefully cute, one-shot that I felt like writing. It's not meant to be anything too amazing. I wanted to try to stay in the 5,000 word area. I forget what inspired me to write this, but I wrote it all in one sitting. This is the first time I've written in this point of view. He thought I would blow it off as long as he gave me a puppy-dog look and said  His friends even encouraged it. Incredibly angry. Ryan wasn't wrong to label me meek. We've been dating for over a year and a half and I've never dared to raise my voice at him. When he forgot my birthday I laughed. When he took Carrie, my younger sister, to a Josh Groban concert, even though he's my favorite musical artist in the world, I told him she really deserved it. And I did. Okay, it's a lot disgusting. But I'm not the most confident girl in the world. Ryan is the only boyfriend I've ever had, and I'll be turning twenty in a few months. We only hooked up because I was in need of a date to senior homecoming and my best friend paid Ryan to take me. He needed the cash and thought I was  and it might be worth it. I wasn't so surprised to find out she had sex. And at first it worked. When he quickly kissed me on the lips and said,  and ran off to football practice I silenced my aching heart. I asked her who he was and she gave me that angelic smile of hers and said,  I wanted to tell her that Ryan had told me what happened between them but I'm too timid to even get mad at my little sister. Granted, she technically is taller than me, standing at an average 5'6, but still. I kept replaying the signs that Ryan was into Carrie through my mind. How could I have not noticed? Then I realized that it wouldn't have mattered. I would have let it go on even if I had known. I finally fell asleep at four AM, only to have to wake up three hours later for my Ancient Greek Literature class. Ryan and I always sat next to each other. Of course I looked horrible. I had three hours of sleep! I woke up with the hugest dark circles under my dull grey eyes, which are usually a bright and perky blue, and no matter how hard I tried my auburn hair just looked mousy brown. And you cheated on me! My mind began to whirl. That's a fake smile. He does that when he's walking all over you. On Thursdays I only had one class and he had three so we always split up. I headed back to the parking lot, surprised at my feisty thoughts. I swear. My mind was under a lot of stress and I was doing things out of character. I fully intended to pat his car with my hand, draw a heart in the dust on his window, then go back home. I began to walk away but I turned back around. Ryan's words kept running through my mind and I couldn't shake them. I could only imagine what he would say. I'd get yelled out, for sure, and probably dumped. And I couldn't have that. But the man standing in front of me was not someone I was particularly thrilled to see. It took me a minute to place who he was, but he had this I-could-care-less look that sparked my memory. I recognized him quickly, anyone who went to my high school would. He hadn't changed too drastically since then. He was still incredibly tall with the same shaggy brown hair, but he had shaved his beard that made him look ten years older. I think it was the same car he drove back at Ridgemont High. He pulled out a pack of cigarettes from his back jean pocket and hit the end against the side of his arm. I was praying to God that he wouldn't recognize me. I knew exactly what he was talking about. Peter, or  as all his friends called him, was known for being a trouble-maker. He was constantly picking fights with anyone who was willing to defend themselves. Word has it that he went to anger management three times and it never worked. I also heard he drank and did drugs. His grip was comfortable. I hadn't known he got arrested. I was surprised when he jogged up to me and blocked my path. I had to look up to view his face, he was incredibly tall. He came awfully close to touching me and I blanched. We had been sitting at the coffee shop for twenty minutes and I still hadn't said a word about Ryan. Peter kept trying to get me to talk but I remained mum. I really did want to tell someone, anyone, but I couldn't bring myself to admit it. The whole situation was really embarrassing. What could it really hurt? It's not like he could judge me. His knuckles, unlike mine, were pure white. It took me a moment to realize they were scarred. That's what my mother and best friend do. Peter squeezed my hand gently, then pulled me back. He patted to the seat next to him and I sat down. I wasn't shocked to hear this, he didn't strike me as gay. But it was odd. Guys don't usually point this out to me, especially after complimenting on me. Or was he hitting on me? Tell him that he better think twice before double-crossing you. Then give him back anything of yours he gave you, go home and slap your sister, then buy yourself something as congratulations for standing up for yourself. I was a little disappointed, although I'm not sure why. I wasn't bawling. I've never been much of a crier. But a few tears were rolling down my cheek, slow and steady. From Peter. From the delinquent in high school. He was standing outside the coffee shop, walking next to a pretty girl. He slipped his hand into the back of her jean pocket and she slapped it away. He smiled at her playfully, a smile that he gave to me. Ryan slung his arm around her shoulder and she rested her head on his. Yes I did. In fact, for a very long time I thought I was them. That used to be me. The girl who Ryan would smile and tease and flirt with. We'd go on movie dates and stay up late into the night making out in the back of his car.

I was a little disappointed, although I'm not sure why. I wasn't bawling. I've never been much of a crier. But a few tears were rolling down my cheek, slow and steady. From Peter. From the delinquent in high school. He was standing outside the coffee shop, walking next to a pretty girl. He slipped his hand into the back of her jean pocket and she slapped it away. He smiled at her playfully, a smile that he gave to me. Ryan slung his arm around her shoulder and she rested her head on his. Yes I did. In fact, for a very long time I thought I was them. That used to be me. The girl who Ryan would smile and tease and flirt with. We'd go on movie dates and stay up late into the night making out in the back of his car. The guy that I actually gave my virginity to, even though I didn't want to. And in the span of two days he suddenly became a creep. A jerk. A guy that girls are told to stay away from. Without giving him an answer I stood up, gathered my books from the chair, and left the coffee shop. Ryan was too far away to notice me but I was glad. I made my way back to the parking lot, Peter trailing behind me. He began to talk about how he was sorry for whatever he said and he didn't mean it. I ignored him. I didn't bother to check if Ryan could see me, or if there was a security guard. For once in my life I was enraged. And I wanted revenge. With a loud crash the bat hit the front of his windshield. It cracked, sending glass splinters in every direction. I hit the windshield a few more times until it was ruined. I moved onto the sides of the car, making dents everywhere I went. I swung the bat so hard into the side mirrors that they flung off. Reaching into my purse I dug out a pale pink lipstick. This wouldn't do. A girl was standing a few feet away, her mouth wide open. I yelled to her,  She nodded and reached into her pocket and tossed me the lipstick. It was daring. It was crazy. In a low voice he said,  He placed his hands on my hips, pulling me close. Perhaps it was the butterflies from before, or maybe I was still flying high from the adrenaline, but I reached my hand to grab Peter's neck and I pulled him down. My first-ever movie kiss. Peter had perfect lips and was a great kisser and obviously into kissing me just as much I was into kissing him. He slid his arms down my waist, down to my thighs where he pulled me up and placed me on Ryan's broken car. One of his hands ran through my hair and the other he ran down my arm. I covered his mouth with my hand and turned to the sound of the voice. His voice raised several pitches and he was completely horrified. The girl he was with from before was trailing behind, her mouth hanging open in an unflattering way. I thought that I must look a trillion times better than she did, what with my lips red from kissing Peter. Ryan always said I looked the best after he kissed me, and he was only an okay kisser. He turned to his new girl toy and muttered,  Candy was staring at him Peter, checking him out from head to toe with a coy smile on her face. When he was out of site Peter turned to me with a grin. My heart rate began to speed up and I began to blabber about how stupid I was and what I just did. I was whirling my hands around so much, raising them to the heavens to curse God for making me so stupid and Peter grabbed them with his hands. AN: This is just kind of a silly, hopefully cute, one-shot that I felt like writing. It's not meant to be anything too amazing. I wanted to try to stay in the 5,000 word area. I forget what inspired me to write this, but I wrote it all in one sitting. This is the first time I've written in this point of view. He thought I would blow it off as long as he gave me a puppy-dog look and said  His friends even encouraged it. Incredibly angry. Ryan wasn't wrong to label me meek. We've been dating for over a year and a half and I've never dared to raise my voice at him. When he forgot my birthday I laughed. When he took Carrie, my younger sister, to a Josh Groban concert, even though he's my favorite musical artist in the world, I told him she really deserved it. And I did. Okay, it's a lot disgusting. But I'm not the most confident girl in the world. Ryan is the only boyfriend I've ever had, and I'll be turning twenty in a few months. We only hooked up because I was in need of a date to senior homecoming and my best friend paid Ryan to take me. He needed the cash and thought I was  and it might be worth it. I wasn't so surprised to find out she had sex. And at first it worked. When he quickly kissed me on the lips and said,  and ran off to football practice I silenced my aching heart. I asked her who he was and she gave me that angelic smile of hers and said,  I wanted to tell her that Ryan had told me what happened between them but I'm too timid to even get mad at my little sister. Granted, she technically is taller than me, standing at an average 5'6, but still. I kept replaying the signs that Ryan was into Carrie through my mind. How could I have not noticed? Then I realized that it wouldn't have mattered. I would have let it go on even if I had known. I finally fell asleep at four AM, only to have to wake up three hours later for my Ancient Greek Literature class. Ryan and I always sat next to each other. Of course I looked horrible. I had three hours of sleep! I woke up with the hugest dark circles under my dull grey eyes, which are usually a bright and perky blue, and no matter how hard I tried my auburn hair just looked mousy brown. And you cheated on me! My mind began to whirl. That's a fake smile. He does that when he's walking all over you. On Thursdays I only had one class and he had three so we always split up. I headed back to the parking lot, surprised at my feisty thoughts. I swear. My mind was under a lot of stress and I was doing things out of character. I fully intended to pat his car with my hand, draw a heart in the dust on his window, then go back home. I began to walk away but I turned back around. Ryan's words kept running through my mind and I couldn't shake them. I could only imagine what he would say. I'd get yelled out, for sure, and probably dumped. And I couldn't have that. But the man standing in front of me was not someone I was particularly thrilled to see. It took me a minute to place who he was, but he had this I-could-care-less look that sparked my memory. I recognized him quickly, anyone who went to my high school would. He hadn't changed too drastically since then. He was still incredibly tall with the same shaggy brown hair, but he had shaved his beard that made him look ten years older. I think it was the same car he drove back at Ridgemont High. He pulled out a pack of cigarettes from his back jean pocket and hit the end against the side of his arm. I was praying to God that he wouldn't recognize me. I knew exactly what he was talking about. Peter, or  as all his friends called him, was known for being a trouble-maker. He was constantly picking fights with anyone who was willing to defend themselves. Word has it that he went to anger management three times and it never worked. I also heard he drank and did drugs. His grip was comfortable. I hadn't known he got arrested. I was surprised when he jogged up to me and blocked my path. I had to look up to view his face, he was incredibly tall. He came awfully close to touching me and I blanched. We had been sitting at the coffee shop for twenty minutes and I still hadn't said a word about Ryan. Peter kept trying to get me to talk but I remained mum. I really did want to tell someone, anyone, but I couldn't bring myself to admit it. The whole situation was really embarrassing. What could it really hurt? It's not like he could judge me. His knuckles, unlike mine, were pure white. It took me a moment to realize they were scarred. That's what my mother and best friend do. Peter squeezed my hand gently, then pulled me back. He patted to the seat next to him and I sat down. I wasn't shocked to hear this, he didn't strike me as gay. But it was odd. Guys don't usually point this out to me, especially after complimenting on me. Or was he hitting on me? Tell him that he better think twice before double-crossing you.

We had been sitting at the coffee shop for twenty minutes and I still hadn't said a word about Ryan. Peter kept trying to get me to talk but I remained mum. I really did want to tell someone, anyone, but I couldn't bring myself to admit it. The whole situation was really embarrassing. What could it really hurt? It's not like he could judge me. His knuckles, unlike mine, were pure white. It took me a moment to realize they were scarred. That's what my mother and best friend do. Peter squeezed my hand gently, then pulled me back. He patted to the seat next to him and I sat down. I wasn't shocked to hear this, he didn't strike me as gay. But it was odd. Guys don't usually point this out to me, especially after complimenting on me. Or was he hitting on me? Tell him that he better think twice before double-crossing you. Then give him back anything of yours he gave you, go home and slap your sister, then buy yourself something as congratulations for standing up for yourself. I was a little disappointed, although I'm not sure why. I wasn't bawling. I've never been much of a crier. But a few tears were rolling down my cheek, slow and steady. From Peter. From the delinquent in high school. He was standing outside the coffee shop, walking next to a pretty girl. He slipped his hand into the back of her jean pocket and she slapped it away. He smiled at her playfully, a smile that he gave to me. Ryan slung his arm around her shoulder and she rested her head on his. Yes I did. In fact, for a very long time I thought I was them. That used to be me. The girl who Ryan would smile and tease and flirt with. We'd go on movie dates and stay up late into the night making out in the back of his car. The guy that I actually gave my virginity to, even though I didn't want to. And in the span of two days he suddenly became a creep. A jerk. A guy that girls are told to stay away from. Without giving him an answer I stood up, gathered my books from the chair, and left the coffee shop. Ryan was too far away to notice me but I was glad. I made my way back to the parking lot, Peter trailing behind me. He began to talk about how he was sorry for whatever he said and he didn't mean it. I ignored him. I didn't bother to check if Ryan could see me, or if there was a security guard. For once in my life I was enraged. And I wanted revenge. With a loud crash the bat hit the front of his windshield. It cracked, sending glass splinters in every direction. I hit the windshield a few more times until it was ruined. I moved onto the sides of the car, making dents everywhere I went. I swung the bat so hard into the side mirrors that they flung off. Reaching into my purse I dug out a pale pink lipstick. This wouldn't do. A girl was standing a few feet away, her mouth wide open. I yelled to her,  She nodded and reached into her pocket and tossed me the lipstick. It was daring. It was crazy. In a low voice he said,  He placed his hands on my hips, pulling me close. Perhaps it was the butterflies from before, or maybe I was still flying high from the adrenaline, but I reached my hand to grab Peter's neck and I pulled him down. My first-ever movie kiss. Peter had perfect lips and was a great kisser and obviously into kissing me just as much I was into kissing him. He slid his arms down my waist, down to my thighs where he pulled me up and placed me on Ryan's broken car. One of his hands ran through my hair and the other he ran down my arm. I covered his mouth with my hand and turned to the sound of the voice. His voice raised several pitches and he was completely horrified. The girl he was with from before was trailing behind, her mouth hanging open in an unflattering way. I thought that I must look a trillion times better than she did, what with my lips red from kissing Peter. Ryan always said I looked the best after he kissed me, and he was only an okay kisser. He turned to his new girl toy and muttered,  Candy was staring at him Peter, checking him out from head to toe with a coy smile on her face. When he was out of site Peter turned to me with a grin. My heart rate began to speed up and I began to blabber about how stupid I was and what I just did. I was whirling my hands around so much, raising them to the heavens to curse God for making me so stupid and Peter grabbed them with his hands. AN: This is just kind of a silly, hopefully cute, one-shot that I felt like writing. It's not meant to be anything too amazing. I wanted to try to stay in the 5,000 word area. I forget what inspired me to write this, but I wrote it all in one sitting. This is the first time I've written in this point of view. He thought I would blow it off as long as he gave me a puppy-dog look and said  His friends even encouraged it. Incredibly angry. Ryan wasn't wrong to label me meek. We've been dating for over a year and a half and I've never dared to raise my voice at him. When he forgot my birthday I laughed. When he took Carrie, my younger sister, to a Josh Groban concert, even though he's my favorite musical artist in the world, I told him she really deserved it. And I did. Okay, it's a lot disgusting. But I'm not the most confident girl in the world. Ryan is the only boyfriend I've ever had, and I'll be turning twenty in a few months. We only hooked up because I was in need of a date to senior homecoming and my best friend paid Ryan to take me. He needed the cash and thought I was  and it might be worth it. I wasn't so surprised to find out she had sex. And at first it worked. When he quickly kissed me on the lips and said,  and ran off to football practice I silenced my aching heart. I asked her who he was and she gave me that angelic smile of hers and said,  I wanted to tell her that Ryan had told me what happened between them but I'm too timid to even get mad at my little sister. Granted, she technically is taller than me, standing at an average 5'6, but still. I kept replaying the signs that Ryan was into Carrie through my mind. How could I have not noticed? Then I realized that it wouldn't have mattered. I would have let it go on even if I had known. I finally fell asleep at four AM, only to have to wake up three hours later for my Ancient Greek Literature class. Ryan and I always sat next to each other. Of course I looked horrible. I had three hours of sleep! I woke up with the hugest dark circles under my dull grey eyes, which are usually a bright and perky blue, and no matter how hard I tried my auburn hair just looked mousy brown. And you cheated on me! My mind began to whirl. That's a fake smile. He does that when he's walking all over you. On Thursdays I only had one class and he had three so we always split up. I headed back to the parking lot, surprised at my feisty thoughts. I swear. My mind was under a lot of stress and I was doing things out of character. I fully intended to pat his car with my hand, draw a heart in the dust on his window, then go back home. I began to walk away but I turned back around. Ryan's words kept running through my mind and I couldn't shake them. I could only imagine what he would say. I'd get yelled out, for sure, and probably dumped. And I couldn't have that. But the man standing in front of me was not someone I was particularly thrilled to see. It took me a minute to place who he was, but he had this I-could-care-less look that sparked my memory. I recognized him quickly, anyone who went to my high school would. He hadn't changed too drastically since then. He was still incredibly tall with the same shaggy brown hair, but he had shaved his beard that made him look ten years older. I think it was the same car he drove back at Ridgemont High. He pulled out a pack of cigarettes from his back jean pocket and hit the end against the side of his arm. I was praying to God that he wouldn't recognize me. I knew exactly what he was talking about. Peter, or  as all his friends called him, was known for being a trouble-maker. He was constantly picking fights with anyone who was willing to defend themselves. Word has it that he went to anger management three times and it never worked. I also heard he drank and did drugs. His grip was comfortable. I hadn't known he got arrested. I was surprised when he jogged up to me and blocked my path. I had to look up to view his face, he was incredibly tall. He came awfully close to touching me and I blanched.

I wasn't one of those girls you'd see hiding in trees or camping on the lawns or sneaking into houses to steal the boxers of the guys they're 'in love' with. Of course not! And – well, would you look at that! He was one of those guys who only looked slightly better-than-average with a straight face, but when he smiled – wham! More like just half a room away. Their blueness was still unbelievably striking, though. He'd stopped laughing and was instead focused on something his friend was telling him. The leftover remnants of a smile were still playing on his lips. I was probably staring a little too hard, because when his eyes suddenly flickered to the side, they caught mine. His eyes were so… blue. He was so not interested. If he had been, he would've come over to introduce himself already. Not that I'd expected him to. I was just having fun admiring his beautiful eyes. Who went to a college frat party alone? Actually, don't answer that. Or in my case, the solution to my aloneness. Alright, so that wasn't really true. I had a tendency to make myself sound a lot more exciting than I really was. No, I didn't so much as  him as stalk. And it wasn't so much  as the dorms. In my inebriated state, I figured I was doing a pretty good job of hiding myself from them. The truth was, they probably knew exactly what I was doing the entire time. In retrospect, it was a good thing that I chose to follow them rather than anybody else, because I ended up outside the dorms right beside my own block. Not that I'd realized that then. Blue Eyes paused in the act of walking just long enough to turn back and shout,  Then with a flash of the smile I was coming to associate with him, he was gone. Well. Gosh. That had been embarrassing. I was never going to drink again, not if it drove me to do stupid things like following the first cute boy back to the dorms. Hopefully, I was probably never going to see him again. The school campus was huge, after all. What were the odds? I saw him on my way to class. I saw him on my way back from class. I'd been expecting an eye-roll at the very least, and an outright lecture on how stalking was for desperate girls who couldn't get a date – which I definitely wasn't so stop stalking random guys already! – at the very most. Finally. I was just starting to worry my best friend's brain had been eaten by an alien. Trust my feminist best friend to make my interest in someone of the male persuasion sound like an insult! It probably wouldn't have gotten much further than that if it hadn't been for the Bus Incident. Even though that was the name I christened it with, the Bus Incident really had very little to do with buses of any sort. I only call it the Bus Incident because it had happened because of the bus. Before I realized that I'd all but confessed to stalking him with those three words. Gosh. It was like his facial muscles couldn't agree on what they wanted to do. Which was really a waste, because when they weren't disagreeing like this, his features made quite a pleasing picture. Although his nose seemed a little too sharp. He'd put it on silent mode, which explained why I hadn't heard any ringing. I could tell he didn't want to stand here and continue listening to my crazy chatter, but manners were preventing him from walking away. Aw. Half-Asian didn't sound almost as cool as half-German did. I supposed he found my obsession with him – with his eyes, rather – amusing. I'd come to realize he smiled a lot. He stood up along with me, flicking a cursory glance over the textbook I'd taken out. What? It'd been weighing down my bag! It wasn't like I was trying to look studious or anything. I was. Really! Sort of. He was there again the next day. And the day after that. Not on Friday though; he told me on our Thursday meeting that his Friday schedule was so packed, it was insane. And of course he was never free after six at night. I had a feeling he led a life much more exciting than mine. It wasn't much – on Mondays when our schedules clashed horribly, we only had time for a hi-bye sort of passing greeting – but it was enough. At that point, I figured it would've just been weird if we went through the whole handshaking routine now, so I let it go. On the other… let's just say I wasn't too psyched about being reminded of my stalking episode every time I spoke to him. Looking into his eyes for thirty minutes straight had nothing to do with it. I hoped he wasn't one of the people who subscribed to such stereotypes. It had been empty for a while. I smothered a giggle. But I couldn't stop wondering what I'd done wrong. When I showed up for our usual meet-up the next Thursday, there was a girl sitting at the table with him. The girl smiled a little shyly at me. I stared at Blue Eyes, willing him to get on with the introductions. And I admit; it hurt. Obviously, I'd been thinking too highly of myself. Gosh! She was beautiful, taller than me, blonde… and she seemed really nice. Gosh. She was exactly the kind of girl Blue Eyes would fall in love with. Looking at them standing side by side, you could tell they were made for each other. She came up to his chin – the perfect height to lean against his shoulder or whatever else couples liked to do. She was perfect for him. Not to mention, he was probably halfway in love with her already. I mean, the only reason I'd started the whole stalking business was because I was attracted to Blue Eyes'… well, blue eyes, right? And there were tons of people in this country with blue eyes. No big deal. I should've known Blue Eyes would track me down eventually. He was persistent like that. I'd been trying to avoid him for the past five days and was, for the moment, quite successful in my endeavors. They would hypnotize me, I knew. I could tell he was smiling. Just the thought of her made him smile. Man, this girl was good. Did my stalking give him an ego-boost or something? Was that why he wanted to keep me around? Oh, gosh, most amazing what? I could hardly talk about eyes again. And that was what I wanted. I didn't feel like going to class anymore. I was a little sick from the heat, I supposed. The sun was shining particularly intensely today, after all. It had nothing to do with the crushing sensation in my heart. And the tears leaking down my cheeks were just an early symptom of some kind of heatstroke. The Thursday night two weeks later saw me moping around the room watching chick flicks on my tiny laptop screen and bingeing on my favorite comfort food – mashed potatoes. What? We couldn't all subscribe to clichés! I still made sure I went for tutorials and finished my assignments on time, after all. Someday, I would tell Rachelle that her consoling skills sucked. It took another month before I could gather up enough courage to take my usual route again. It was the route that required me to walk past the Halls of Residence Fourteen on the way back to my own dorms. I'd been taking detours so that I wouldn't have to pass by Blue Eyes' block and risk running into him, but it was raining heavily that day and I didn't have any energy to take the longer route. I could understand why. He was by the lamppost I'd hidden behind that very first day I'd followed him back to his dorms. I winced at the chilly reception I was receiving. I couldn't possibly admit that I had been jealous of Maddy. He was suddenly looking at me with more interest than before. His standing out in the rain made sense now. He was probably heartbroken. Or at least, I'd thought he was going to leave, but after a couple of steps he swung back around and fixed me with a blazing glare. I stared. His hair was drenched and hanging limply in his eyes – those beautiful eyes that were now darkened with anger – and he was apparently about to unleash his full wrath on me, but the only thing I was thinking about in that moment was that he could still make my heart beat faster even when he looked like a drowned rat. It seemed that whatever he wanted to get off his chest was more important than getting out of the rain. That way, he wouldn't be able to see how close I was to tears. It was fine if he didn't like me. Maybe I'd only been attracted to him because of his beautiful eyes and brilliant smile – at first. But as the days had gone by and I'd gotten to know more about him, what I'd fallen for was his personality. It seemed to be the only reaction I was capable of getting out of him since I'd run into him that afternoon. He snapped. I turned around again, but this time he moved fast enough to push himself in front of me, into the small space under my umbrella. And Maddy would be perfect for that. I'd seen how he could break into a smile simply at the thought of her. His fingers were ice cold. Then he exhaled loudly. Once. Twice. Thrice. I didn't like it when he looked so obviously frustrated. Gosh. I glared at the wet ground, at our shoes. He was wearing Converses that were completely drenched. Gosh. Not in terms of passion, but temperature. His lips were so cold that when they touched mine, I jumped at the shiver that surged through my body as a result. And I'd never understood all that hoo-hah over kissing in the rain; I'd never found it particularly romantic, just very wet and uncomfortable. He must've dropped the umbrella at some point. I found that I didn't really care. Author's Note: So! Another one-shot. The character Blue Eyes (or Logan, as his name turns out to be) was inspired by this real guy I've been seeing around campus. . . a lot. He has the bluest eyes and the most amazing smile and I get the feeling he thinks I'm stalking him (which I am not. There's this thing called a complete coincidence). And he always laughs at me whenever we happen to meet and he catches me staring. . . Although I have to admit that last scene is completely fictional. Sadly. I wasn't one of those girls you'd see hiding in trees or camping on the lawns or sneaking into houses to steal the boxers of the guys they're 'in love' with. Of course not! And – well, would you look at that! He was one of those guys who only looked slightly better-than-average with a straight face, but when he smiled – wham! More like just half a room away. Their blueness was still unbelievably striking, though. He'd stopped laughing and was instead focused on something his friend was telling him. The leftover remnants of a smile were still playing on his lips. I was probably staring a little too hard, because when his eyes suddenly flickered to the side, they caught mine. His eyes were so… blue. He was so not interested. If he had been, he would've come over to introduce himself already. Not that I'd expected him to. I was just having fun admiring his beautiful eyes. Who went to a college frat party alone? Actually, don't answer that. Or in my case, the solution to my aloneness. Alright, so that wasn't really true. I had a tendency to make myself sound a lot more exciting than I really was. No, I didn't so much as  him as stalk. And it wasn't so much  as the dorms. In my inebriated state, I figured I was doing a pretty good job of hiding myself from them. The truth was, they probably knew exactly what I was doing the entire time. In retrospect, it was a good thing that I chose to follow them rather than anybody else, because I ended up outside the dorms right beside my own block. Not that I'd realized that then. Blue Eyes paused in the act of walking just long enough to turn back and shout,  Then with a flash of the smile I was coming to associate with him, he was gone. Well. Gosh. That had been embarrassing. I was never going to drink again, not if it drove me to do stupid things like following the first cute boy back to the dorms. Hopefully, I was probably never going to see him again. The school campus was huge, after all. What were the odds? I saw him on my way to class. I saw him on my way back from class. I'd been expecting an eye-roll at the very least, and an outright lecture on how stalking was for desperate girls who couldn't get a date – which I definitely wasn't so stop stalking random guys already! – at the very most. Finally. I was just starting to worry my best friend's brain had been eaten by an alien. Trust my feminist best friend to make my interest in someone of the male persuasion sound like an insult! It probably wouldn't have gotten much further than that if it hadn't been for the Bus Incident. Even though that was the name I christened it with, the Bus Incident really had very little to do with buses of any sort. I only call it the Bus Incident because it had happened because of the bus. Before I realized that I'd all but confessed to stalking him with those three words. Gosh. It was like his facial muscles couldn't agree on what they wanted to do. Which was really a waste, because when they weren't disagreeing like this, his features made quite a pleasing picture. Although his nose seemed a little too sharp. He'd put it on silent mode, which explained why I hadn't heard any ringing. I could tell he didn't want to stand here and continue listening to my crazy chatter, but manners were preventing him from walking away. Aw. Half-Asian didn't sound almost as cool as half-German did. I supposed he found my obsession with him – with his eyes, rather – amusing. I'd come to realize he smiled a lot. He stood up along with me, flicking a cursory glance over the textbook I'd taken out. What? It'd been weighing down my bag! It wasn't like I was trying to look studious or anything. I was. Really! Sort of. He was there again the next day. And the day after that. Not on Friday though; he told me on our Thursday meeting that his Friday schedule was so packed, it was insane. And of course he was never free after six at night. I had a feeling he led a life much more exciting than mine. It wasn't much – on Mondays when our schedules clashed horribly, we only had time for a hi-bye sort of passing greeting – but it was enough. At that point, I figured it would've just been weird if we went through the whole handshaking routine now, so I let it go. On the other… let's just say I wasn't too psyched about being reminded of my stalking episode every time I spoke to him. Looking into his eyes for thirty minutes straight had nothing to do with it. I hoped he wasn't one of the people who subscribed to such stereotypes. It had been empty for a while. I smothered a giggle. But I couldn't stop wondering what I'd done wrong. When I showed up for our usual meet-up the next Thursday, there was a girl sitting at the table with him. The girl smiled a little shyly at me. I stared at Blue Eyes, willing him to get on with the introductions. And I admit; it hurt. Obviously, I'd been thinking too highly of myself. Gosh! She was beautiful, taller than me, blonde… and she seemed really nice. Gosh. She was exactly the kind of girl Blue Eyes would fall in love with. Looking at them standing side by side, you could tell they were made for each other. She came up to his chin – the perfect height to lean against his shoulder or whatever else couples liked to do. She was perfect for him. Not to mention, he was probably halfway in love with her already. I mean, the only reason I'd started the whole stalking business was because I was attracted to Blue Eyes'… well, blue eyes, right? And there were tons of people in this country with blue eyes. No big deal. I should've known Blue Eyes would track me down eventually. He was persistent like that.

The character Blue Eyes (or Logan, as his name turns out to be) was inspired by this real guy I've been seeing around campus. . . a lot. He has the bluest eyes and the most amazing smile and I get the feeling he thinks I'm stalking him (which I am not. There's this thing called a complete coincidence). And he always laughs at me whenever we happen to meet and he catches me staring. . . Although I have to admit that last scene is completely fictional. Sadly. I wasn't one of those girls you'd see hiding in trees or camping on the lawns or sneaking into houses to steal the boxers of the guys they're 'in love' with. Of course not! And – well, would you look at that! He was one of those guys who only looked slightly better-than-average with a straight face, but when he smiled – wham! More like just half a room away. Their blueness was still unbelievably striking, though. He'd stopped laughing and was instead focused on something his friend was telling him. The leftover remnants of a smile were still playing on his lips. I was probably staring a little too hard, because when his eyes suddenly flickered to the side, they caught mine. His eyes were so… blue. He was so not interested. If he had been, he would've come over to introduce himself already. Not that I'd expected him to. I was just having fun admiring his beautiful eyes. Who went to a college frat party alone? Actually, don't answer that. Or in my case, the solution to my aloneness. Alright, so that wasn't really true. I had a tendency to make myself sound a lot more exciting than I really was. No, I didn't so much as  him as stalk. And it wasn't so much  as the dorms. In my inebriated state, I figured I was doing a pretty good job of hiding myself from them. The truth was, they probably knew exactly what I was doing the entire time. In retrospect, it was a good thing that I chose to follow them rather than anybody else, because I ended up outside the dorms right beside my own block. Not that I'd realized that then. Blue Eyes paused in the act of walking just long enough to turn back and shout,  Then with a flash of the smile I was coming to associate with him, he was gone. Well. Gosh. That had been embarrassing. I was never going to drink again, not if it drove me to do stupid things like following the first cute boy back to the dorms. Hopefully, I was probably never going to see him again. The school campus was huge, after all. What were the odds? I saw him on my way to class. I saw him on my way back from class. I'd been expecting an eye-roll at the very least, and an outright lecture on how stalking was for desperate girls who couldn't get a date – which I definitely wasn't so stop stalking random guys already! – at the very most. Finally. I was just starting to worry my best friend's brain had been eaten by an alien. Trust my feminist best friend to make my interest in someone of the male persuasion sound like an insult! It probably wouldn't have gotten much further than that if it hadn't been for the Bus Incident. Even though that was the name I christened it with, the Bus Incident really had very little to do with buses of any sort. I only call it the Bus Incident because it had happened because of the bus. Before I realized that I'd all but confessed to stalking him with those three words. Gosh. It was like his facial muscles couldn't agree on what they wanted to do. Which was really a waste, because when they weren't disagreeing like this, his features made quite a pleasing picture. Although his nose seemed a little too sharp. He'd put it on silent mode, which explained why I hadn't heard any ringing. I could tell he didn't want to stand here and continue listening to my crazy chatter, but manners were preventing him from walking away. Aw. Half-Asian didn't sound almost as cool as half-German did. I supposed he found my obsession with him – with his eyes, rather – amusing. I'd come to realize he smiled a lot. He stood up along with me, flicking a cursory glance over the textbook I'd taken out. What? It'd been weighing down my bag! It wasn't like I was trying to look studious or anything. I was. Really! Sort of. He was there again the next day. And the day after that. Not on Friday though; he told me on our Thursday meeting that his Friday schedule was so packed, it was insane. And of course he was never free after six at night. I had a feeling he led a life much more exciting than mine. It wasn't much – on Mondays when our schedules clashed horribly, we only had time for a hi-bye sort of passing greeting – but it was enough. At that point, I figured it would've just been weird if we went through the whole handshaking routine now, so I let it go. On the other… let's just say I wasn't too psyched about being reminded of my stalking episode every time I spoke to him. Looking into his eyes for thirty minutes straight had nothing to do with it. I hoped he wasn't one of the people who subscribed to such stereotypes. It had been empty for a while. I smothered a giggle. But I couldn't stop wondering what I'd done wrong. When I showed up for our usual meet-up the next Thursday, there was a girl sitting at the table with him. The girl smiled a little shyly at me. I stared at Blue Eyes, willing him to get on with the introductions. And I admit; it hurt. Obviously, I'd been thinking too highly of myself. Gosh! She was beautiful, taller than me, blonde… and she seemed really nice. Gosh. She was exactly the kind of girl Blue Eyes would fall in love with. Looking at them standing side by side, you could tell they were made for each other. She came up to his chin – the perfect height to lean against his shoulder or whatever else couples liked to do. She was perfect for him. Not to mention, he was probably halfway in love with her already. I mean, the only reason I'd started the whole stalking business was because I was attracted to Blue Eyes'… well, blue eyes, right? And there were tons of people in this country with blue eyes. No big deal. I should've known Blue Eyes would track me down eventually. He was persistent like that. I'd been trying to avoid him for the past five days and was, for the moment, quite successful in my endeavors. They would hypnotize me, I knew. I could tell he was smiling. Just the thought of her made him smile. Man, this girl was good. Did my stalking give him an ego-boost or something? Was that why he wanted to keep me around? Oh, gosh, most amazing what? I could hardly talk about eyes again. And that was what I wanted. I didn't feel like going to class anymore. I was a little sick from the heat, I supposed. The sun was shining particularly intensely today, after all. It had nothing to do with the crushing sensation in my heart. And the tears leaking down my cheeks were just an early symptom of some kind of heatstroke. The Thursday night two weeks later saw me moping around the room watching chick flicks on my tiny laptop screen and bingeing on my favorite comfort food – mashed potatoes. What? We couldn't all subscribe to clichés! I still made sure I went for tutorials and finished my assignments on time, after all. Someday, I would tell Rachelle that her consoling skills sucked. It took another month before I could gather up enough courage to take my usual route again. It was the route that required me to walk past the Halls of Residence Fourteen on the way back to my own dorms. I'd been taking detours so that I wouldn't have to pass by Blue Eyes' block and risk running into him, but it was raining heavily that day and I didn't have any energy to take the longer route. I could understand why. He was by the lamppost I'd hidden behind that very first day I'd followed him back to his dorms. I winced at the chilly reception I was receiving. I couldn't possibly admit that I had been jealous of Maddy. He was suddenly looking at me with more interest than before. His standing out in the rain made sense now. He was probably heartbroken. Or at least, I'd thought he was going to leave, but after a couple of steps he swung back around and fixed me with a blazing glare. I stared. His hair was drenched and hanging limply in his eyes – those beautiful eyes that were now darkened with anger – and he was apparently about to unleash his full wrath on me, but the only thing I was thinking about in that moment was that he could still make my heart beat faster even when he looked like a drowned rat. It seemed that whatever he wanted to get off his chest was more important than getting out of the rain. That way, he wouldn't be able to see how close I was to tears. It was fine if he didn't like me. Maybe I'd only been attracted to him because of his beautiful eyes and brilliant smile – at first. But as the days had gone by and I'd gotten to know more about him, what I'd fallen for was his personality. It seemed to be the only reaction I was capable of getting out of him since I'd run into him that afternoon. He snapped. I turned around again, but this time he moved fast enough to push himself in front of me, into the small space under my umbrella. And Maddy would be perfect for that. I'd seen how he could break into a smile simply at the thought of her. His fingers were ice cold. Then he exhaled loudly. Once. Twice. Thrice. I didn't like it when he looked so obviously frustrated. Gosh. I glared at the wet ground, at our shoes. He was wearing Converses that were completely drenched. Gosh. Not in terms of passion, but temperature. His lips were so cold that when they touched mine, I jumped at the shiver that surged through my body as a result. And I'd never understood all that hoo-hah over kissing in the rain; I'd never found it particularly romantic, just very wet and uncomfortable. He must've dropped the umbrella at some point.

I could tell he didn't want to stand here and continue listening to my crazy chatter, but manners were preventing him from walking away. Aw. Half-Asian didn't sound almost as cool as half-German did. I supposed he found my obsession with him – with his eyes, rather – amusing. I'd come to realize he smiled a lot. He stood up along with me, flicking a cursory glance over the textbook I'd taken out. What? It'd been weighing down my bag! It wasn't like I was trying to look studious or anything. I was. Really! Sort of. He was there again the next day. And the day after that. Not on Friday though; he told me on our Thursday meeting that his Friday schedule was so packed, it was insane. And of course he was never free after six at night. I had a feeling he led a life much more exciting than mine. It wasn't much – on Mondays when our schedules clashed horribly, we only had time for a hi-bye sort of passing greeting – but it was enough. At that point, I figured it would've just been weird if we went through the whole handshaking routine now, so I let it go. On the other… let's just say I wasn't too psyched about being reminded of my stalking episode every time I spoke to him. Looking into his eyes for thirty minutes straight had nothing to do with it. I hoped he wasn't one of the people who subscribed to such stereotypes. It had been empty for a while. I smothered a giggle. But I couldn't stop wondering what I'd done wrong. When I showed up for our usual meet-up the next Thursday, there was a girl sitting at the table with him. The girl smiled a little shyly at me. I stared at Blue Eyes, willing him to get on with the introductions. And I admit; it hurt. Obviously, I'd been thinking too highly of myself. Gosh! She was beautiful, taller than me, blonde… and she seemed really nice. Gosh. She was exactly the kind of girl Blue Eyes would fall in love with. Looking at them standing side by side, you could tell they were made for each other. She came up to his chin – the perfect height to lean against his shoulder or whatever else couples liked to do. She was perfect for him. Not to mention, he was probably halfway in love with her already. I mean, the only reason I'd started the whole stalking business was because I was attracted to Blue Eyes'… well, blue eyes, right? And there were tons of people in this country with blue eyes. No big deal. I should've known Blue Eyes would track me down eventually. He was persistent like that. I'd been trying to avoid him for the past five days and was, for the moment, quite successful in my endeavors. They would hypnotize me, I knew. I could tell he was smiling. Just the thought of her made him smile. Man, this girl was good. Did my stalking give him an ego-boost or something? Was that why he wanted to keep me around? Oh, gosh, most amazing what? I could hardly talk about eyes again. And that was what I wanted. I didn't feel like going to class anymore. I was a little sick from the heat, I supposed. The sun was shining particularly intensely today, after all. It had nothing to do with the crushing sensation in my heart. And the tears leaking down my cheeks were just an early symptom of some kind of heatstroke. The Thursday night two weeks later saw me moping around the room watching chick flicks on my tiny laptop screen and bingeing on my favorite comfort food – mashed potatoes. What? We couldn't all subscribe to clichés! I still made sure I went for tutorials and finished my assignments on time, after all. Someday, I would tell Rachelle that her consoling skills sucked. It took another month before I could gather up enough courage to take my usual route again. It was the route that required me to walk past the Halls of Residence Fourteen on the way back to my own dorms. I'd been taking detours so that I wouldn't have to pass by Blue Eyes' block and risk running into him, but it was raining heavily that day and I didn't have any energy to take the longer route. I could understand why. He was by the lamppost I'd hidden behind that very first day I'd followed him back to his dorms. I winced at the chilly reception I was receiving. I couldn't possibly admit that I had been jealous of Maddy. He was suddenly looking at me with more interest than before. His standing out in the rain made sense now. He was probably heartbroken. Or at least, I'd thought he was going to leave, but after a couple of steps he swung back around and fixed me with a blazing glare. I stared. His hair was drenched and hanging limply in his eyes – those beautiful eyes that were now darkened with anger – and he was apparently about to unleash his full wrath on me, but the only thing I was thinking about in that moment was that he could still make my heart beat faster even when he looked like a drowned rat. It seemed that whatever he wanted to get off his chest was more important than getting out of the rain. That way, he wouldn't be able to see how close I was to tears. It was fine if he didn't like me. Maybe I'd only been attracted to him because of his beautiful eyes and brilliant smile – at first. But as the days had gone by and I'd gotten to know more about him, what I'd fallen for was his personality. It seemed to be the only reaction I was capable of getting out of him since I'd run into him that afternoon. He snapped. I turned around again, but this time he moved fast enough to push himself in front of me, into the small space under my umbrella. And Maddy would be perfect for that. I'd seen how he could break into a smile simply at the thought of her. His fingers were ice cold. Then he exhaled loudly. Once. Twice. Thrice. I didn't like it when he looked so obviously frustrated. Gosh. I glared at the wet ground, at our shoes. He was wearing Converses that were completely drenched. Gosh. Not in terms of passion, but temperature. His lips were so cold that when they touched mine, I jumped at the shiver that surged through my body as a result. And I'd never understood all that hoo-hah over kissing in the rain; I'd never found it particularly romantic, just very wet and uncomfortable. He must've dropped the umbrella at some point. I found that I didn't really care. Author's Note: So! Another one-shot. The character Blue Eyes (or Logan, as his name turns out to be) was inspired by this real guy I've been seeing around campus. . . a lot. He has the bluest eyes and the most amazing smile and I get the feeling he thinks I'm stalking him (which I am not. There's this thing called a complete coincidence). And he always laughs at me whenever we happen to meet and he catches me staring. . . Although I have to admit that last scene is completely fictional. Sadly. I wasn't one of those girls you'd see hiding in trees or camping on the lawns or sneaking into houses to steal the boxers of the guys they're 'in love' with. Of course not! And – well, would you look at that! He was one of those guys who only looked slightly better-than-average with a straight face, but when he smiled – wham! More like just half a room away. Their blueness was still unbelievably striking, though. He'd stopped laughing and was instead focused on something his friend was telling him. The leftover remnants of a smile were still playing on his lips. I was probably staring a little too hard, because when his eyes suddenly flickered to the side, they caught mine. His eyes were so… blue. He was so not interested. If he had been, he would've come over to introduce himself already. Not that I'd expected him to. I was just having fun admiring his beautiful eyes. Who went to a college frat party alone? Actually, don't answer that. Or in my case, the solution to my aloneness. Alright, so that wasn't really true. I had a tendency to make myself sound a lot more exciting than I really was. No, I didn't so much as  him as stalk. And it wasn't so much  as the dorms. In my inebriated state, I figured I was doing a pretty good job of hiding myself from them. The truth was, they probably knew exactly what I was doing the entire time. In retrospect, it was a good thing that I chose to follow them rather than anybody else, because I ended up outside the dorms right beside my own block. Not that I'd realized that then. Blue Eyes paused in the act of walking just long enough to turn back and shout,  Then with a flash of the smile I was coming to associate with him, he was gone. Well. Gosh. That had been embarrassing. I was never going to drink again, not if it drove me to do stupid things like following the first cute boy back to the dorms. Hopefully, I was probably never going to see him again. The school campus was huge, after all. What were the odds? I saw him on my way to class. I saw him on my way back from class. I'd been expecting an eye-roll at the very least, and an outright lecture on how stalking was for desperate girls who couldn't get a date – which I definitely wasn't so stop stalking random guys already! – at the very most. Finally. I was just starting to worry my best friend's brain had been eaten by an alien. Trust my feminist best friend to make my interest in someone of the male persuasion sound like an insult! It probably wouldn't have gotten much further than that if it hadn't been for the Bus Incident. Even though that was the name I christened it with, the Bus Incident really had very little to do with buses of any sort. I only call it the Bus Incident because it had happened because of the bus. Before I realized that I'd all but confessed to stalking him with those three words. Gosh. It was like his facial muscles couldn't agree on what they wanted to do.

It was the route that required me to walk past the Halls of Residence Fourteen on the way back to my own dorms. I'd been taking detours so that I wouldn't have to pass by Blue Eyes' block and risk running into him, but it was raining heavily that day and I didn't have any energy to take the longer route. I could understand why. He was by the lamppost I'd hidden behind that very first day I'd followed him back to his dorms. I winced at the chilly reception I was receiving. I couldn't possibly admit that I had been jealous of Maddy. He was suddenly looking at me with more interest than before. His standing out in the rain made sense now. He was probably heartbroken. Or at least, I'd thought he was going to leave, but after a couple of steps he swung back around and fixed me with a blazing glare. I stared. His hair was drenched and hanging limply in his eyes – those beautiful eyes that were now darkened with anger – and he was apparently about to unleash his full wrath on me, but the only thing I was thinking about in that moment was that he could still make my heart beat faster even when he looked like a drowned rat. It seemed that whatever he wanted to get off his chest was more important than getting out of the rain. That way, he wouldn't be able to see how close I was to tears. It was fine if he didn't like me. Maybe I'd only been attracted to him because of his beautiful eyes and brilliant smile – at first. But as the days had gone by and I'd gotten to know more about him, what I'd fallen for was his personality. It seemed to be the only reaction I was capable of getting out of him since I'd run into him that afternoon. He snapped. I turned around again, but this time he moved fast enough to push himself in front of me, into the small space under my umbrella. And Maddy would be perfect for that. I'd seen how he could break into a smile simply at the thought of her. His fingers were ice cold. Then he exhaled loudly. Once. Twice. Thrice. I didn't like it when he looked so obviously frustrated. Gosh. I glared at the wet ground, at our shoes. He was wearing Converses that were completely drenched. Gosh. Not in terms of passion, but temperature. His lips were so cold that when they touched mine, I jumped at the shiver that surged through my body as a result. And I'd never understood all that hoo-hah over kissing in the rain; I'd never found it particularly romantic, just very wet and uncomfortable. He must've dropped the umbrella at some point. I found that I didn't really care. Author's Note: So! Another one-shot. The character Blue Eyes (or Logan, as his name turns out to be) was inspired by this real guy I've been seeing around campus. . . a lot. He has the bluest eyes and the most amazing smile and I get the feeling he thinks I'm stalking him (which I am not. There's this thing called a complete coincidence). And he always laughs at me whenever we happen to meet and he catches me staring. . . Although I have to admit that last scene is completely fictional. Sadly. I wasn't one of those girls you'd see hiding in trees or camping on the lawns or sneaking into houses to steal the boxers of the guys they're 'in love' with. Of course not! And – well, would you look at that! He was one of those guys who only looked slightly better-than-average with a straight face, but when he smiled – wham! More like just half a room away. Their blueness was still unbelievably striking, though. He'd stopped laughing and was instead focused on something his friend was telling him. The leftover remnants of a smile were still playing on his lips. I was probably staring a little too hard, because when his eyes suddenly flickered to the side, they caught mine. His eyes were so… blue. He was so not interested. If he had been, he would've come over to introduce himself already. Not that I'd expected him to. I was just having fun admiring his beautiful eyes. Who went to a college frat party alone? Actually, don't answer that. Or in my case, the solution to my aloneness. Alright, so that wasn't really true. I had a tendency to make myself sound a lot more exciting than I really was. No, I didn't so much as  him as stalk. And it wasn't so much  as the dorms. In my inebriated state, I figured I was doing a pretty good job of hiding myself from them. The truth was, they probably knew exactly what I was doing the entire time. In retrospect, it was a good thing that I chose to follow them rather than anybody else, because I ended up outside the dorms right beside my own block. Not that I'd realized that then. Blue Eyes paused in the act of walking just long enough to turn back and shout,  Then with a flash of the smile I was coming to associate with him, he was gone. Well. Gosh. That had been embarrassing. I was never going to drink again, not if it drove me to do stupid things like following the first cute boy back to the dorms. Hopefully, I was probably never going to see him again. The school campus was huge, after all. What were the odds? I saw him on my way to class. I saw him on my way back from class. I'd been expecting an eye-roll at the very least, and an outright lecture on how stalking was for desperate girls who couldn't get a date – which I definitely wasn't so stop stalking random guys already! – at the very most. Finally. I was just starting to worry my best friend's brain had been eaten by an alien. Trust my feminist best friend to make my interest in someone of the male persuasion sound like an insult! It probably wouldn't have gotten much further than that if it hadn't been for the Bus Incident. Even though that was the name I christened it with, the Bus Incident really had very little to do with buses of any sort. I only call it the Bus Incident because it had happened because of the bus. Before I realized that I'd all but confessed to stalking him with those three words. Gosh. It was like his facial muscles couldn't agree on what they wanted to do. Which was really a waste, because when they weren't disagreeing like this, his features made quite a pleasing picture. Although his nose seemed a little too sharp. He'd put it on silent mode, which explained why I hadn't heard any ringing. I could tell he didn't want to stand here and continue listening to my crazy chatter, but manners were preventing him from walking away. Aw. Half-Asian didn't sound almost as cool as half-German did. I supposed he found my obsession with him – with his eyes, rather – amusing. I'd come to realize he smiled a lot. He stood up along with me, flicking a cursory glance over the textbook I'd taken out. What? It'd been weighing down my bag! It wasn't like I was trying to look studious or anything. I was. Really! Sort of. He was there again the next day. And the day after that. Not on Friday though; he told me on our Thursday meeting that his Friday schedule was so packed, it was insane. And of course he was never free after six at night. I had a feeling he led a life much more exciting than mine. It wasn't much – on Mondays when our schedules clashed horribly, we only had time for a hi-bye sort of passing greeting – but it was enough. At that point, I figured it would've just been weird if we went through the whole handshaking routine now, so I let it go. On the other… let's just say I wasn't too psyched about being reminded of my stalking episode every time I spoke to him. Looking into his eyes for thirty minutes straight had nothing to do with it. I hoped he wasn't one of the people who subscribed to such stereotypes. It had been empty for a while. I smothered a giggle. But I couldn't stop wondering what I'd done wrong. When I showed up for our usual meet-up the next Thursday, there was a girl sitting at the table with him. The girl smiled a little shyly at me. I stared at Blue Eyes, willing him to get on with the introductions. And I admit; it hurt. Obviously, I'd been thinking too highly of myself. Gosh! She was beautiful, taller than me, blonde… and she seemed really nice. Gosh. She was exactly the kind of girl Blue Eyes would fall in love with. Looking at them standing side by side, you could tell they were made for each other. She came up to his chin – the perfect height to lean against his shoulder or whatever else couples liked to do. She was perfect for him. Not to mention, he was probably halfway in love with her already. I mean, the only reason I'd started the whole stalking business was because I was attracted to Blue Eyes'… well, blue eyes, right? And there were tons of people in this country with blue eyes. No big deal. I should've known Blue Eyes would track me down eventually. He was persistent like that. I'd been trying to avoid him for the past five days and was, for the moment, quite successful in my endeavors. They would hypnotize me, I knew. I could tell he was smiling. Just the thought of her made him smile. Man, this girl was good. Did my stalking give him an ego-boost or something? Was that why he wanted to keep me around? Oh, gosh, most amazing what? I could hardly talk about eyes again. And that was what I wanted. I didn't feel like going to class anymore. I was a little sick from the heat, I supposed. The sun was shining particularly intensely today, after all. It had nothing to do with the crushing sensation in my heart. And the tears leaking down my cheeks were just an early symptom of some kind of heatstroke. The Thursday night two weeks later saw me moping around the room watching chick flicks on my tiny laptop screen and bingeing on my favorite comfort food – mashed potatoes. What?

The leftover remnants of a smile were still playing on his lips. I was probably staring a little too hard, because when his eyes suddenly flickered to the side, they caught mine. His eyes were so… blue. He was so not interested. If he had been, he would've come over to introduce himself already. Not that I'd expected him to. I was just having fun admiring his beautiful eyes. Who went to a college frat party alone? Actually, don't answer that. Or in my case, the solution to my aloneness. Alright, so that wasn't really true. I had a tendency to make myself sound a lot more exciting than I really was. No, I didn't so much as  him as stalk. And it wasn't so much  as the dorms. In my inebriated state, I figured I was doing a pretty good job of hiding myself from them. The truth was, they probably knew exactly what I was doing the entire time. In retrospect, it was a good thing that I chose to follow them rather than anybody else, because I ended up outside the dorms right beside my own block. Not that I'd realized that then. Blue Eyes paused in the act of walking just long enough to turn back and shout,  Then with a flash of the smile I was coming to associate with him, he was gone. Well. Gosh. That had been embarrassing. I was never going to drink again, not if it drove me to do stupid things like following the first cute boy back to the dorms. Hopefully, I was probably never going to see him again. The school campus was huge, after all. What were the odds? I saw him on my way to class. I saw him on my way back from class. I'd been expecting an eye-roll at the very least, and an outright lecture on how stalking was for desperate girls who couldn't get a date – which I definitely wasn't so stop stalking random guys already! – at the very most. Finally. I was just starting to worry my best friend's brain had been eaten by an alien. Trust my feminist best friend to make my interest in someone of the male persuasion sound like an insult! It probably wouldn't have gotten much further than that if it hadn't been for the Bus Incident. Even though that was the name I christened it with, the Bus Incident really had very little to do with buses of any sort. I only call it the Bus Incident because it had happened because of the bus. Before I realized that I'd all but confessed to stalking him with those three words. Gosh. It was like his facial muscles couldn't agree on what they wanted to do. Which was really a waste, because when they weren't disagreeing like this, his features made quite a pleasing picture. Although his nose seemed a little too sharp. He'd put it on silent mode, which explained why I hadn't heard any ringing. I could tell he didn't want to stand here and continue listening to my crazy chatter, but manners were preventing him from walking away. Aw. Half-Asian didn't sound almost as cool as half-German did. I supposed he found my obsession with him – with his eyes, rather – amusing. I'd come to realize he smiled a lot. He stood up along with me, flicking a cursory glance over the textbook I'd taken out. What? It'd been weighing down my bag! It wasn't like I was trying to look studious or anything. I was. Really! Sort of. He was there again the next day. And the day after that. Not on Friday though; he told me on our Thursday meeting that his Friday schedule was so packed, it was insane. And of course he was never free after six at night. I had a feeling he led a life much more exciting than mine. It wasn't much – on Mondays when our schedules clashed horribly, we only had time for a hi-bye sort of passing greeting – but it was enough. At that point, I figured it would've just been weird if we went through the whole handshaking routine now, so I let it go. On the other… let's just say I wasn't too psyched about being reminded of my stalking episode every time I spoke to him. Looking into his eyes for thirty minutes straight had nothing to do with it. I hoped he wasn't one of the people who subscribed to such stereotypes. It had been empty for a while. I smothered a giggle. But I couldn't stop wondering what I'd done wrong. When I showed up for our usual meet-up the next Thursday, there was a girl sitting at the table with him. The girl smiled a little shyly at me. I stared at Blue Eyes, willing him to get on with the introductions. And I admit; it hurt. Obviously, I'd been thinking too highly of myself. Gosh! She was beautiful, taller than me, blonde… and she seemed really nice. Gosh. She was exactly the kind of girl Blue Eyes would fall in love with. Looking at them standing side by side, you could tell they were made for each other. She came up to his chin – the perfect height to lean against his shoulder or whatever else couples liked to do. She was perfect for him. Not to mention, he was probably halfway in love with her already. I mean, the only reason I'd started the whole stalking business was because I was attracted to Blue Eyes'… well, blue eyes, right? And there were tons of people in this country with blue eyes. No big deal. I should've known Blue Eyes would track me down eventually. He was persistent like that. I'd been trying to avoid him for the past five days and was, for the moment, quite successful in my endeavors. They would hypnotize me, I knew. I could tell he was smiling. Just the thought of her made him smile. Man, this girl was good. Did my stalking give him an ego-boost or something? Was that why he wanted to keep me around? Oh, gosh, most amazing what? I could hardly talk about eyes again. And that was what I wanted. I didn't feel like going to class anymore. I was a little sick from the heat, I supposed. The sun was shining particularly intensely today, after all. It had nothing to do with the crushing sensation in my heart. And the tears leaking down my cheeks were just an early symptom of some kind of heatstroke. The Thursday night two weeks later saw me moping around the room watching chick flicks on my tiny laptop screen and bingeing on my favorite comfort food – mashed potatoes. What? We couldn't all subscribe to clichés! I still made sure I went for tutorials and finished my assignments on time, after all. Someday, I would tell Rachelle that her consoling skills sucked. It took another month before I could gather up enough courage to take my usual route again. It was the route that required me to walk past the Halls of Residence Fourteen on the way back to my own dorms. I'd been taking detours so that I wouldn't have to pass by Blue Eyes' block and risk running into him, but it was raining heavily that day and I didn't have any energy to take the longer route. I could understand why. He was by the lamppost I'd hidden behind that very first day I'd followed him back to his dorms. I winced at the chilly reception I was receiving. I couldn't possibly admit that I had been jealous of Maddy. He was suddenly looking at me with more interest than before. His standing out in the rain made sense now. He was probably heartbroken. Or at least, I'd thought he was going to leave, but after a couple of steps he swung back around and fixed me with a blazing glare. I stared. His hair was drenched and hanging limply in his eyes – those beautiful eyes that were now darkened with anger – and he was apparently about to unleash his full wrath on me, but the only thing I was thinking about in that moment was that he could still make my heart beat faster even when he looked like a drowned rat. It seemed that whatever he wanted to get off his chest was more important than getting out of the rain. That way, he wouldn't be able to see how close I was to tears. It was fine if he didn't like me. Maybe I'd only been attracted to him because of his beautiful eyes and brilliant smile – at first. But as the days had gone by and I'd gotten to know more about him, what I'd fallen for was his personality. It seemed to be the only reaction I was capable of getting out of him since I'd run into him that afternoon. He snapped. I turned around again, but this time he moved fast enough to push himself in front of me, into the small space under my umbrella. And Maddy would be perfect for that. I'd seen how he could break into a smile simply at the thought of her. His fingers were ice cold. Then he exhaled loudly. Once. Twice. Thrice. I didn't like it when he looked so obviously frustrated. Gosh. I glared at the wet ground, at our shoes. He was wearing Converses that were completely drenched. Gosh. Not in terms of passion, but temperature. His lips were so cold that when they touched mine, I jumped at the shiver that surged through my body as a result. And I'd never understood all that hoo-hah over kissing in the rain; I'd never found it particularly romantic, just very wet and uncomfortable. He must've dropped the umbrella at some point. I found that I didn't really care. Author's Note: So! Another one-shot. The character Blue Eyes (or Logan, as his name turns out to be) was inspired by this real guy I've been seeing around campus. . . a lot. He has the bluest eyes and the most amazing smile and I get the feeling he thinks I'm stalking him (which I am not. There's this thing called a complete coincidence).

It wasn't much – on Mondays when our schedules clashed horribly, we only had time for a hi-bye sort of passing greeting – but it was enough. At that point, I figured it would've just been weird if we went through the whole handshaking routine now, so I let it go. On the other… let's just say I wasn't too psyched about being reminded of my stalking episode every time I spoke to him. Looking into his eyes for thirty minutes straight had nothing to do with it. I hoped he wasn't one of the people who subscribed to such stereotypes. It had been empty for a while. I smothered a giggle. But I couldn't stop wondering what I'd done wrong. When I showed up for our usual meet-up the next Thursday, there was a girl sitting at the table with him. The girl smiled a little shyly at me. I stared at Blue Eyes, willing him to get on with the introductions. And I admit; it hurt. Obviously, I'd been thinking too highly of myself. Gosh! She was beautiful, taller than me, blonde… and she seemed really nice. Gosh. She was exactly the kind of girl Blue Eyes would fall in love with. Looking at them standing side by side, you could tell they were made for each other. She came up to his chin – the perfect height to lean against his shoulder or whatever else couples liked to do. She was perfect for him. Not to mention, he was probably halfway in love with her already. I mean, the only reason I'd started the whole stalking business was because I was attracted to Blue Eyes'… well, blue eyes, right? And there were tons of people in this country with blue eyes. No big deal. I should've known Blue Eyes would track me down eventually. He was persistent like that. I'd been trying to avoid him for the past five days and was, for the moment, quite successful in my endeavors. They would hypnotize me, I knew. I could tell he was smiling. Just the thought of her made him smile. Man, this girl was good. Did my stalking give him an ego-boost or something? Was that why he wanted to keep me around? Oh, gosh, most amazing what? I could hardly talk about eyes again. And that was what I wanted. I didn't feel like going to class anymore. I was a little sick from the heat, I supposed. The sun was shining particularly intensely today, after all. It had nothing to do with the crushing sensation in my heart. And the tears leaking down my cheeks were just an early symptom of some kind of heatstroke. The Thursday night two weeks later saw me moping around the room watching chick flicks on my tiny laptop screen and bingeing on my favorite comfort food – mashed potatoes. What? We couldn't all subscribe to clichés! I still made sure I went for tutorials and finished my assignments on time, after all. Someday, I would tell Rachelle that her consoling skills sucked. It took another month before I could gather up enough courage to take my usual route again. It was the route that required me to walk past the Halls of Residence Fourteen on the way back to my own dorms. I'd been taking detours so that I wouldn't have to pass by Blue Eyes' block and risk running into him, but it was raining heavily that day and I didn't have any energy to take the longer route. I could understand why. He was by the lamppost I'd hidden behind that very first day I'd followed him back to his dorms. I winced at the chilly reception I was receiving. I couldn't possibly admit that I had been jealous of Maddy. He was suddenly looking at me with more interest than before. His standing out in the rain made sense now. He was probably heartbroken. Or at least, I'd thought he was going to leave, but after a couple of steps he swung back around and fixed me with a blazing glare. I stared. His hair was drenched and hanging limply in his eyes – those beautiful eyes that were now darkened with anger – and he was apparently about to unleash his full wrath on me, but the only thing I was thinking about in that moment was that he could still make my heart beat faster even when he looked like a drowned rat. It seemed that whatever he wanted to get off his chest was more important than getting out of the rain. That way, he wouldn't be able to see how close I was to tears. It was fine if he didn't like me. Maybe I'd only been attracted to him because of his beautiful eyes and brilliant smile – at first. But as the days had gone by and I'd gotten to know more about him, what I'd fallen for was his personality. It seemed to be the only reaction I was capable of getting out of him since I'd run into him that afternoon. He snapped. I turned around again, but this time he moved fast enough to push himself in front of me, into the small space under my umbrella. And Maddy would be perfect for that. I'd seen how he could break into a smile simply at the thought of her. His fingers were ice cold. Then he exhaled loudly. Once. Twice. Thrice. I didn't like it when he looked so obviously frustrated. Gosh. I glared at the wet ground, at our shoes. He was wearing Converses that were completely drenched. Gosh. Not in terms of passion, but temperature. His lips were so cold that when they touched mine, I jumped at the shiver that surged through my body as a result. And I'd never understood all that hoo-hah over kissing in the rain; I'd never found it particularly romantic, just very wet and uncomfortable. He must've dropped the umbrella at some point. I found that I didn't really care. Author's Note: So! Another one-shot. The character Blue Eyes (or Logan, as his name turns out to be) was inspired by this real guy I've been seeing around campus. . . a lot. He has the bluest eyes and the most amazing smile and I get the feeling he thinks I'm stalking him (which I am not. There's this thing called a complete coincidence). And he always laughs at me whenever we happen to meet and he catches me staring. . . Although I have to admit that last scene is completely fictional. Sadly. I wasn't one of those girls you'd see hiding in trees or camping on the lawns or sneaking into houses to steal the boxers of the guys they're 'in love' with. Of course not! And – well, would you look at that! He was one of those guys who only looked slightly better-than-average with a straight face, but when he smiled – wham! More like just half a room away. Their blueness was still unbelievably striking, though. He'd stopped laughing and was instead focused on something his friend was telling him. The leftover remnants of a smile were still playing on his lips. I was probably staring a little too hard, because when his eyes suddenly flickered to the side, they caught mine. His eyes were so… blue. He was so not interested. If he had been, he would've come over to introduce himself already. Not that I'd expected him to. I was just having fun admiring his beautiful eyes. Who went to a college frat party alone? Actually, don't answer that. Or in my case, the solution to my aloneness. Alright, so that wasn't really true. I had a tendency to make myself sound a lot more exciting than I really was. No, I didn't so much as  him as stalk. And it wasn't so much  as the dorms. In my inebriated state, I figured I was doing a pretty good job of hiding myself from them. The truth was, they probably knew exactly what I was doing the entire time. In retrospect, it was a good thing that I chose to follow them rather than anybody else, because I ended up outside the dorms right beside my own block. Not that I'd realized that then. Blue Eyes paused in the act of walking just long enough to turn back and shout,  Then with a flash of the smile I was coming to associate with him, he was gone. Well. Gosh. That had been embarrassing. I was never going to drink again, not if it drove me to do stupid things like following the first cute boy back to the dorms. Hopefully, I was probably never going to see him again. The school campus was huge, after all. What were the odds? I saw him on my way to class. I saw him on my way back from class. I'd been expecting an eye-roll at the very least, and an outright lecture on how stalking was for desperate girls who couldn't get a date – which I definitely wasn't so stop stalking random guys already! – at the very most. Finally. I was just starting to worry my best friend's brain had been eaten by an alien. Trust my feminist best friend to make my interest in someone of the male persuasion sound like an insult! It probably wouldn't have gotten much further than that if it hadn't been for the Bus Incident. Even though that was the name I christened it with, the Bus Incident really had very little to do with buses of any sort. I only call it the Bus Incident because it had happened because of the bus. Before I realized that I'd all but confessed to stalking him with those three words. Gosh. It was like his facial muscles couldn't agree on what they wanted to do. Which was really a waste, because when they weren't disagreeing like this, his features made quite a pleasing picture. Although his nose seemed a little too sharp. He'd put it on silent mode, which explained why I hadn't heard any ringing. I could tell he didn't want to stand here and continue listening to my crazy chatter, but manners were preventing him from walking away. Aw. Half-Asian didn't sound almost as cool as half-German did. I supposed he found my obsession with him – with his eyes, rather – amusing. I'd come to realize he smiled a lot. He stood up along with me, flicking a cursory glance over the textbook I'd taken out. What? It'd been weighing down my bag! It wasn't like I was trying to look studious or anything. I was. Really! Sort of. He was there again the next day. And the day after that.

His hair was drenched and hanging limply in his eyes – those beautiful eyes that were now darkened with anger – and he was apparently about to unleash his full wrath on me, but the only thing I was thinking about in that moment was that he could still make my heart beat faster even when he looked like a drowned rat. It seemed that whatever he wanted to get off his chest was more important than getting out of the rain. That way, he wouldn't be able to see how close I was to tears. It was fine if he didn't like me. Maybe I'd only been attracted to him because of his beautiful eyes and brilliant smile – at first. But as the days had gone by and I'd gotten to know more about him, what I'd fallen for was his personality. It seemed to be the only reaction I was capable of getting out of him since I'd run into him that afternoon. He snapped. I turned around again, but this time he moved fast enough to push himself in front of me, into the small space under my umbrella. And Maddy would be perfect for that. I'd seen how he could break into a smile simply at the thought of her. His fingers were ice cold. Then he exhaled loudly. Once. Twice. Thrice. I didn't like it when he looked so obviously frustrated. Gosh. I glared at the wet ground, at our shoes. He was wearing Converses that were completely drenched. Gosh. Not in terms of passion, but temperature. His lips were so cold that when they touched mine, I jumped at the shiver that surged through my body as a result. And I'd never understood all that hoo-hah over kissing in the rain; I'd never found it particularly romantic, just very wet and uncomfortable. He must've dropped the umbrella at some point. I found that I didn't really care. Author's Note: So! Another one-shot. The character Blue Eyes (or Logan, as his name turns out to be) was inspired by this real guy I've been seeing around campus. . . a lot. He has the bluest eyes and the most amazing smile and I get the feeling he thinks I'm stalking him (which I am not. There's this thing called a complete coincidence). And he always laughs at me whenever we happen to meet and he catches me staring. . . Although I have to admit that last scene is completely fictional. Sadly. I wasn't one of those girls you'd see hiding in trees or camping on the lawns or sneaking into houses to steal the boxers of the guys they're 'in love' with. Of course not! And – well, would you look at that! He was one of those guys who only looked slightly better-than-average with a straight face, but when he smiled – wham! More like just half a room away. Their blueness was still unbelievably striking, though. He'd stopped laughing and was instead focused on something his friend was telling him. The leftover remnants of a smile were still playing on his lips. I was probably staring a little too hard, because when his eyes suddenly flickered to the side, they caught mine. His eyes were so… blue. He was so not interested. If he had been, he would've come over to introduce himself already. Not that I'd expected him to. I was just having fun admiring his beautiful eyes. Who went to a college frat party alone? Actually, don't answer that. Or in my case, the solution to my aloneness. Alright, so that wasn't really true. I had a tendency to make myself sound a lot more exciting than I really was. No, I didn't so much as  him as stalk. And it wasn't so much  as the dorms. In my inebriated state, I figured I was doing a pretty good job of hiding myself from them. The truth was, they probably knew exactly what I was doing the entire time. In retrospect, it was a good thing that I chose to follow them rather than anybody else, because I ended up outside the dorms right beside my own block. Not that I'd realized that then. Blue Eyes paused in the act of walking just long enough to turn back and shout,  Then with a flash of the smile I was coming to associate with him, he was gone. Well. Gosh. That had been embarrassing. I was never going to drink again, not if it drove me to do stupid things like following the first cute boy back to the dorms. Hopefully, I was probably never going to see him again. The school campus was huge, after all. What were the odds? I saw him on my way to class. I saw him on my way back from class. I'd been expecting an eye-roll at the very least, and an outright lecture on how stalking was for desperate girls who couldn't get a date – which I definitely wasn't so stop stalking random guys already! – at the very most. Finally. I was just starting to worry my best friend's brain had been eaten by an alien. Trust my feminist best friend to make my interest in someone of the male persuasion sound like an insult! It probably wouldn't have gotten much further than that if it hadn't been for the Bus Incident. Even though that was the name I christened it with, the Bus Incident really had very little to do with buses of any sort. I only call it the Bus Incident because it had happened because of the bus. Before I realized that I'd all but confessed to stalking him with those three words. Gosh. It was like his facial muscles couldn't agree on what they wanted to do. Which was really a waste, because when they weren't disagreeing like this, his features made quite a pleasing picture. Although his nose seemed a little too sharp. He'd put it on silent mode, which explained why I hadn't heard any ringing. I could tell he didn't want to stand here and continue listening to my crazy chatter, but manners were preventing him from walking away. Aw. Half-Asian didn't sound almost as cool as half-German did. I supposed he found my obsession with him – with his eyes, rather – amusing. I'd come to realize he smiled a lot. He stood up along with me, flicking a cursory glance over the textbook I'd taken out. What? It'd been weighing down my bag! It wasn't like I was trying to look studious or anything. I was. Really! Sort of. He was there again the next day. And the day after that. Not on Friday though; he told me on our Thursday meeting that his Friday schedule was so packed, it was insane. And of course he was never free after six at night. I had a feeling he led a life much more exciting than mine. It wasn't much – on Mondays when our schedules clashed horribly, we only had time for a hi-bye sort of passing greeting – but it was enough. At that point, I figured it would've just been weird if we went through the whole handshaking routine now, so I let it go. On the other… let's just say I wasn't too psyched about being reminded of my stalking episode every time I spoke to him. Looking into his eyes for thirty minutes straight had nothing to do with it. I hoped he wasn't one of the people who subscribed to such stereotypes. It had been empty for a while. I smothered a giggle. But I couldn't stop wondering what I'd done wrong. When I showed up for our usual meet-up the next Thursday, there was a girl sitting at the table with him. The girl smiled a little shyly at me. I stared at Blue Eyes, willing him to get on with the introductions. And I admit; it hurt. Obviously, I'd been thinking too highly of myself. Gosh! She was beautiful, taller than me, blonde… and she seemed really nice. Gosh. She was exactly the kind of girl Blue Eyes would fall in love with. Looking at them standing side by side, you could tell they were made for each other. She came up to his chin – the perfect height to lean against his shoulder or whatever else couples liked to do. She was perfect for him. Not to mention, he was probably halfway in love with her already. I mean, the only reason I'd started the whole stalking business was because I was attracted to Blue Eyes'… well, blue eyes, right? And there were tons of people in this country with blue eyes. No big deal. I should've known Blue Eyes would track me down eventually. He was persistent like that. I'd been trying to avoid him for the past five days and was, for the moment, quite successful in my endeavors. They would hypnotize me, I knew. I could tell he was smiling. Just the thought of her made him smile. Man, this girl was good. Did my stalking give him an ego-boost or something? Was that why he wanted to keep me around? Oh, gosh, most amazing what? I could hardly talk about eyes again. And that was what I wanted. I didn't feel like going to class anymore. I was a little sick from the heat, I supposed. The sun was shining particularly intensely today, after all. It had nothing to do with the crushing sensation in my heart. And the tears leaking down my cheeks were just an early symptom of some kind of heatstroke. The Thursday night two weeks later saw me moping around the room watching chick flicks on my tiny laptop screen and bingeing on my favorite comfort food – mashed potatoes. What? We couldn't all subscribe to clichés! I still made sure I went for tutorials and finished my assignments on time, after all. Someday, I would tell Rachelle that her consoling skills sucked. It took another month before I could gather up enough courage to take my usual route again. It was the route that required me to walk past the Halls of Residence Fourteen on the way back to my own dorms. I'd been taking detours so that I wouldn't have to pass by Blue Eyes' block and risk running into him, but it was raining heavily that day and I didn't have any energy to take the longer route. I could understand why. He was by the lamppost I'd hidden behind that very first day I'd followed him back to his dorms. I winced at the chilly reception I was receiving. I couldn't possibly admit that I had been jealous of Maddy. He was suddenly looking at me with more interest than before. His standing out in the rain made sense now. He was probably heartbroken.

In retrospect, it was a good thing that I chose to follow them rather than anybody else, because I ended up outside the dorms right beside my own block. Not that I'd realized that then. Blue Eyes paused in the act of walking just long enough to turn back and shout,  Then with a flash of the smile I was coming to associate with him, he was gone. Well. Gosh. That had been embarrassing. I was never going to drink again, not if it drove me to do stupid things like following the first cute boy back to the dorms. Hopefully, I was probably never going to see him again. The school campus was huge, after all. What were the odds? I saw him on my way to class. I saw him on my way back from class. I'd been expecting an eye-roll at the very least, and an outright lecture on how stalking was for desperate girls who couldn't get a date – which I definitely wasn't so stop stalking random guys already! – at the very most. Finally. I was just starting to worry my best friend's brain had been eaten by an alien. Trust my feminist best friend to make my interest in someone of the male persuasion sound like an insult! It probably wouldn't have gotten much further than that if it hadn't been for the Bus Incident. Even though that was the name I christened it with, the Bus Incident really had very little to do with buses of any sort. I only call it the Bus Incident because it had happened because of the bus. Before I realized that I'd all but confessed to stalking him with those three words. Gosh. It was like his facial muscles couldn't agree on what they wanted to do. Which was really a waste, because when they weren't disagreeing like this, his features made quite a pleasing picture. Although his nose seemed a little too sharp. He'd put it on silent mode, which explained why I hadn't heard any ringing. I could tell he didn't want to stand here and continue listening to my crazy chatter, but manners were preventing him from walking away. Aw. Half-Asian didn't sound almost as cool as half-German did. I supposed he found my obsession with him – with his eyes, rather – amusing. I'd come to realize he smiled a lot. He stood up along with me, flicking a cursory glance over the textbook I'd taken out. What? It'd been weighing down my bag! It wasn't like I was trying to look studious or anything. I was. Really! Sort of. He was there again the next day. And the day after that. Not on Friday though; he told me on our Thursday meeting that his Friday schedule was so packed, it was insane. And of course he was never free after six at night. I had a feeling he led a life much more exciting than mine. It wasn't much – on Mondays when our schedules clashed horribly, we only had time for a hi-bye sort of passing greeting – but it was enough. At that point, I figured it would've just been weird if we went through the whole handshaking routine now, so I let it go. On the other… let's just say I wasn't too psyched about being reminded of my stalking episode every time I spoke to him. Looking into his eyes for thirty minutes straight had nothing to do with it. I hoped he wasn't one of the people who subscribed to such stereotypes. It had been empty for a while. I smothered a giggle. But I couldn't stop wondering what I'd done wrong. When I showed up for our usual meet-up the next Thursday, there was a girl sitting at the table with him. The girl smiled a little shyly at me. I stared at Blue Eyes, willing him to get on with the introductions. And I admit; it hurt. Obviously, I'd been thinking too highly of myself. Gosh! She was beautiful, taller than me, blonde… and she seemed really nice. Gosh. She was exactly the kind of girl Blue Eyes would fall in love with. Looking at them standing side by side, you could tell they were made for each other. She came up to his chin – the perfect height to lean against his shoulder or whatever else couples liked to do. She was perfect for him. Not to mention, he was probably halfway in love with her already. I mean, the only reason I'd started the whole stalking business was because I was attracted to Blue Eyes'… well, blue eyes, right? And there were tons of people in this country with blue eyes. No big deal. I should've known Blue Eyes would track me down eventually. He was persistent like that. I'd been trying to avoid him for the past five days and was, for the moment, quite successful in my endeavors. They would hypnotize me, I knew. I could tell he was smiling. Just the thought of her made him smile. Man, this girl was good. Did my stalking give him an ego-boost or something? Was that why he wanted to keep me around? Oh, gosh, most amazing what? I could hardly talk about eyes again. And that was what I wanted. I didn't feel like going to class anymore. I was a little sick from the heat, I supposed. The sun was shining particularly intensely today, after all. It had nothing to do with the crushing sensation in my heart. And the tears leaking down my cheeks were just an early symptom of some kind of heatstroke. The Thursday night two weeks later saw me moping around the room watching chick flicks on my tiny laptop screen and bingeing on my favorite comfort food – mashed potatoes. What? We couldn't all subscribe to clichés! I still made sure I went for tutorials and finished my assignments on time, after all. Someday, I would tell Rachelle that her consoling skills sucked. It took another month before I could gather up enough courage to take my usual route again. It was the route that required me to walk past the Halls of Residence Fourteen on the way back to my own dorms. I'd been taking detours so that I wouldn't have to pass by Blue Eyes' block and risk running into him, but it was raining heavily that day and I didn't have any energy to take the longer route. I could understand why. He was by the lamppost I'd hidden behind that very first day I'd followed him back to his dorms. I winced at the chilly reception I was receiving. I couldn't possibly admit that I had been jealous of Maddy. He was suddenly looking at me with more interest than before. His standing out in the rain made sense now. He was probably heartbroken. Or at least, I'd thought he was going to leave, but after a couple of steps he swung back around and fixed me with a blazing glare. I stared. His hair was drenched and hanging limply in his eyes – those beautiful eyes that were now darkened with anger – and he was apparently about to unleash his full wrath on me, but the only thing I was thinking about in that moment was that he could still make my heart beat faster even when he looked like a drowned rat. It seemed that whatever he wanted to get off his chest was more important than getting out of the rain. That way, he wouldn't be able to see how close I was to tears. It was fine if he didn't like me. Maybe I'd only been attracted to him because of his beautiful eyes and brilliant smile – at first. But as the days had gone by and I'd gotten to know more about him, what I'd fallen for was his personality. It seemed to be the only reaction I was capable of getting out of him since I'd run into him that afternoon. He snapped. I turned around again, but this time he moved fast enough to push himself in front of me, into the small space under my umbrella. And Maddy would be perfect for that. I'd seen how he could break into a smile simply at the thought of her. His fingers were ice cold. Then he exhaled loudly. Once. Twice. Thrice. I didn't like it when he looked so obviously frustrated. Gosh. I glared at the wet ground, at our shoes. He was wearing Converses that were completely drenched. Gosh. Not in terms of passion, but temperature. His lips were so cold that when they touched mine, I jumped at the shiver that surged through my body as a result. And I'd never understood all that hoo-hah over kissing in the rain; I'd never found it particularly romantic, just very wet and uncomfortable. He must've dropped the umbrella at some point. I found that I didn't really care. Author's Note: So! Another one-shot. The character Blue Eyes (or Logan, as his name turns out to be) was inspired by this real guy I've been seeing around campus. . . a lot. He has the bluest eyes and the most amazing smile and I get the feeling he thinks I'm stalking him (which I am not. There's this thing called a complete coincidence). And he always laughs at me whenever we happen to meet and he catches me staring. . . Although I have to admit that last scene is completely fictional. Sadly. ! It was pointless really. ! !

Every human and werewolf turned their head and followed him with their stares, males with begrudging acknowledgement, some with admiration, and females with lust, hunger and unhidden invitation. But Aiden never took the willing females into his bed; he rejected so many of them, from the ugliest to the prettiest, until people started to think he might have a secret mate. . . or that he's gay. But those were just the wounded females who though so; no alpha in the world could be gay; it simply wasn't in their archaic instincts. Work, family and friends could sometimes be too overwhelming, especially the latter. We were on the brink of the Mating Season, an unpredictable period that comes once or twice a year and makes every werewolf in the world crazed with lust, aka the Haze, which resulted in werewolves from age sixteen onward to crave sex with his/her mate, but if a werewolf doesn't find the mate or is still young enough to actually make the act of mating, he/she finds another willing, available partner to mess around during the Season until it finally ends and the Haze is gone. Therefore, there's no male or female werewolf after the age of sixteen who's a virgin. Michelle, my best friend, wanted me to find myself a fuck-buddy too, and she didn't tire of trying; she set me up with three of her brother's friends, and while they seemed perfectly decent and were blunt that they thought me fit for a good time in the sack, I turned them down. I was the only virgin she-wolf after the age of sixteen. At nineteen, I'd been through six Mating Seasons and hadn't had my virginity taken, no matter how sex-crazed I had been. It was very un-wolf-y of me to want to have sex for the first time with someone I cared about, since wolves didn't treat virginity the same way humans did. Deep inside the central park, the river was a quiet place were only the sound of the trickling water broke the silence. I could sit there on the grass, inches away from the water itself, and watch the flowing water for hours. It was a secret place none of my friends and family knew about. He seemed to be lost in thoughts, his face gloomy and serious and his greenish-gold eyes a little glazed. His jet-black hair was disheveled, almost as if he'd been in bed before coming here and didn't bother taking a look at it and from his profile, I could see that one dark lock fell into his face. He didn't seem to notice. What was he doing here, of all the places in the city? Didn't he have alpha-related things to do? It was Tuesday, after all. A regular working day, even for the alpha, who had his own daily duties, like helping the innocent and doing things for the greater good for his pack members. Maybe he was taking a break of everything, just like I did. I took out of my bag my sketch notebook and a pencil. Looking for a few more moments at the river, I started absentmindedly sketching the outlines of the riverbank. It didn't require thinking too much, and I turned my mind into automatic-pilot mode. Of course they thought I was an amazing artist, but making a job out of it wasn't on their agenda. They wanted me to do something , like being a lawyer. That's why they'd sent me to Law school right after high school, which I dropped out of after a month because I knew it wasn't my destiny to become a lawyer. They were furious with me, telling me that from being an artist I wouldn't see a dollar, but I refused to listen to them. They also thought they knew what's best for my older sister, Selene, who instead of becoming a lawyer became a fashion designer – and was goddamn good at it. Unfortunately, though, my parents hadn't learned the lesson with her. But just on this one, screw them. Now it was time for shadows. I did that, along the way fixing a few sketching mistakes, and then lowered the pencil and watched the result. Startled, I didn't stop sketching but did glance toward the alpha who sat not so far away from me. He was glancing at me too and our eyes met. I tensed, realized I was still looking directly into his eyes, and immediately looked away. No one in his right mind looked the alpha in the eyes. It had only two meanings: Challenging the alpha to a dominance/leadership dual which always resulted in the un-alpha part's death, or inviting him to have sex. Since I was still a female, I couldn't help ogling his body for a little bit; ripped muscles evident beneath his tee and jeans, and biceps to die for. His golden skin made him look even more delicious, and his face was so brutally handsome it hurt. Mostly we would see the alpha in occasions like gatherings or balls or something like that. The alpha was still a person, as half-human as every other werewolf, and he obviously needed his time to himself, too. So I decided to keep this tiny bit of info to myself. Melissa Mercer was a fifty-seven-year-old woman with smooth white-blonde hair, silvery eyes and soft paddings. She was also a human doctor in the local hospital, despite being a werewolf herself. Twenty-five years ago, a human man who'd been in a car accident was taken to the hospital. She hadn't been a doctor yet, but she still helped out when he was in need of immediate surgery. After the surgery, Melissa felt the need to keep an eye on him until he got better. They'd looked into each other's eyes for a long time, until the recognition dawned on Melissa. Melissa didn't mind that her mate was human; in a way it was better for her, since she'd always thought werewolves were too aggressive for her. Besides, how could she give her own mate up? It simply wasn't done. Melissa couldn't leave the newborn alone, and took the baby back home. Melissa, my mother, told me this story many times in the past as I grew up. She wanted me to know of my adoption, but she also wanted me to know that it didn't matter if she gave birth to me or someone else did, that I was her baby girl either way. But, unfortunately, it did matter. She was in the kitchen, baking cookies, when I entered the house. she told me as she turned back to her cookies and I poured myself a glass of water. Jeremy, my sister's mate for two years now, was the alpha's personal lawyer (much to my parents' happiness) and mostly he didn't have surprise-meetings like the one he apparently had today. Maybe the alpha's gloomy mood from back in the river turned even gloomier by something. I recalled Aiden's somber face from the riverbank, his aloofness and the way his square jaw was clenched so seriously. He didn't seem like he was getting over a shot to his ego that his best pal hook  woman. I was only nineteen, no longer a juvenile but yet to be a full-grown woman. It took me about half an hour before I was happy with the result of both sketches, and once I was finished with this, I checked my phone for new messages. I had only one and it was from Michelle: Call me ASAP. After a few rings she finally did. Mia was a common friend of ours whose dream was to find her mate until she's twenty, settle down and start spawning babies. It was uncommon for werewolves to recognize each other as mates when before they were anything but. Usually mates find each other by looking into each other's eyes and recognize the other person as his/her mate, like my parents, like my sister and her mate. Even lovers who turned out to be mates after a certain amount of time they were together was more common than what had happened to Mia. See, Mia and Harry had a completely platonic friendship. That they turned out to be mates. . . The Mating Season was almost here, every werewolf could sense it now, that it was only a matter of days. Michelle had a partner to pass this Season. So did Mia, apparently, and my other friends. I was the only one who didn't arrange herself anyone. Tall, dark and sexy, he was everything a girl couldn't resist.

So did Mia, apparently, and my other friends. I was the only one who didn't arrange herself anyone. Tall, dark and sexy, he was everything a girl couldn't resist. Every human and werewolf turned their head and followed him with their stares, males with begrudging acknowledgement, some with admiration, and females with lust, hunger and unhidden invitation. But Aiden never took the willing females into his bed; he rejected so many of them, from the ugliest to the prettiest, until people started to think he might have a secret mate. . . or that he's gay. But those were just the wounded females who though so; no alpha in the world could be gay; it simply wasn't in their archaic instincts. Work, family and friends could sometimes be too overwhelming, especially the latter. We were on the brink of the Mating Season, an unpredictable period that comes once or twice a year and makes every werewolf in the world crazed with lust, aka the Haze, which resulted in werewolves from age sixteen onward to crave sex with his/her mate, but if a werewolf doesn't find the mate or is still young enough to actually make the act of mating, he/she finds another willing, available partner to mess around during the Season until it finally ends and the Haze is gone. Therefore, there's no male or female werewolf after the age of sixteen who's a virgin. Michelle, my best friend, wanted me to find myself a fuck-buddy too, and she didn't tire of trying; she set me up with three of her brother's friends, and while they seemed perfectly decent and were blunt that they thought me fit for a good time in the sack, I turned them down. I was the only virgin she-wolf after the age of sixteen. At nineteen, I'd been through six Mating Seasons and hadn't had my virginity taken, no matter how sex-crazed I had been. It was very un-wolf-y of me to want to have sex for the first time with someone I cared about, since wolves didn't treat virginity the same way humans did. Deep inside the central park, the river was a quiet place were only the sound of the trickling water broke the silence. I could sit there on the grass, inches away from the water itself, and watch the flowing water for hours. It was a secret place none of my friends and family knew about. He seemed to be lost in thoughts, his face gloomy and serious and his greenish-gold eyes a little glazed. His jet-black hair was disheveled, almost as if he'd been in bed before coming here and didn't bother taking a look at it and from his profile, I could see that one dark lock fell into his face. He didn't seem to notice. What was he doing here, of all the places in the city? Didn't he have alpha-related things to do? It was Tuesday, after all. A regular working day, even for the alpha, who had his own daily duties, like helping the innocent and doing things for the greater good for his pack members. Maybe he was taking a break of everything, just like I did. I took out of my bag my sketch notebook and a pencil. Looking for a few more moments at the river, I started absentmindedly sketching the outlines of the riverbank. It didn't require thinking too much, and I turned my mind into automatic-pilot mode. Of course they thought I was an amazing artist, but making a job out of it wasn't on their agenda. They wanted me to do something , like being a lawyer. That's why they'd sent me to Law school right after high school, which I dropped out of after a month because I knew it wasn't my destiny to become a lawyer. They were furious with me, telling me that from being an artist I wouldn't see a dollar, but I refused to listen to them. They also thought they knew what's best for my older sister, Selene, who instead of becoming a lawyer became a fashion designer – and was goddamn good at it. Unfortunately, though, my parents hadn't learned the lesson with her. But just on this one, screw them. Now it was time for shadows. I did that, along the way fixing a few sketching mistakes, and then lowered the pencil and watched the result. Startled, I didn't stop sketching but did glance toward the alpha who sat not so far away from me. He was glancing at me too and our eyes met. I tensed, realized I was still looking directly into his eyes, and immediately looked away. No one in his right mind looked the alpha in the eyes. It had only two meanings: Challenging the alpha to a dominance/leadership dual which always resulted in the un-alpha part's death, or inviting him to have sex. Since I was still a female, I couldn't help ogling his body for a little bit; ripped muscles evident beneath his tee and jeans, and biceps to die for. His golden skin made him look even more delicious, and his face was so brutally handsome it hurt. Mostly we would see the alpha in occasions like gatherings or balls or something like that. The alpha was still a person, as half-human as every other werewolf, and he obviously needed his time to himself, too. So I decided to keep this tiny bit of info to myself. Melissa Mercer was a fifty-seven-year-old woman with smooth white-blonde hair, silvery eyes and soft paddings. She was also a human doctor in the local hospital, despite being a werewolf herself. Twenty-five years ago, a human man who'd been in a car accident was taken to the hospital. She hadn't been a doctor yet, but she still helped out when he was in need of immediate surgery. After the surgery, Melissa felt the need to keep an eye on him until he got better. They'd looked into each other's eyes for a long time, until the recognition dawned on Melissa. Melissa didn't mind that her mate was human; in a way it was better for her, since she'd always thought werewolves were too aggressive for her. Besides, how could she give her own mate up? It simply wasn't done. Melissa couldn't leave the newborn alone, and took the baby back home. Melissa, my mother, told me this story many times in the past as I grew up. She wanted me to know of my adoption, but she also wanted me to know that it didn't matter if she gave birth to me or someone else did, that I was her baby girl either way. But, unfortunately, it did matter. She was in the kitchen, baking cookies, when I entered the house. she told me as she turned back to her cookies and I poured myself a glass of water. Jeremy, my sister's mate for two years now, was the alpha's personal lawyer (much to my parents' happiness) and mostly he didn't have surprise-meetings like the one he apparently had today. Maybe the alpha's gloomy mood from back in the river turned even gloomier by something. I recalled Aiden's somber face from the riverbank, his aloofness and the way his square jaw was clenched so seriously. He didn't seem like he was getting over a shot to his ego that his best pal hook  woman. I was only nineteen, no longer a juvenile but yet to be a full-grown woman. It took me about half an hour before I was happy with the result of both sketches, and once I was finished with this, I checked my phone for new messages. I had only one and it was from Michelle: Call me ASAP. After a few rings she finally did. Mia was a common friend of ours whose dream was to find her mate until she's twenty, settle down and start spawning babies. It was uncommon for werewolves to recognize each other as mates when before they were anything but. Usually mates find each other by looking into each other's eyes and recognize the other person as his/her mate, like my parents, like my sister and her mate.

He didn't seem to notice. What was he doing here, of all the places in the city? Didn't he have alpha-related things to do? It was Tuesday, after all. A regular working day, even for the alpha, who had his own daily duties, like helping the innocent and doing things for the greater good for his pack members. Maybe he was taking a break of everything, just like I did. I took out of my bag my sketch notebook and a pencil. Looking for a few more moments at the river, I started absentmindedly sketching the outlines of the riverbank. It didn't require thinking too much, and I turned my mind into automatic-pilot mode. Of course they thought I was an amazing artist, but making a job out of it wasn't on their agenda. They wanted me to do something , like being a lawyer. That's why they'd sent me to Law school right after high school, which I dropped out of after a month because I knew it wasn't my destiny to become a lawyer. They were furious with me, telling me that from being an artist I wouldn't see a dollar, but I refused to listen to them. They also thought they knew what's best for my older sister, Selene, who instead of becoming a lawyer became a fashion designer – and was goddamn good at it. Unfortunately, though, my parents hadn't learned the lesson with her. But just on this one, screw them. Now it was time for shadows. I did that, along the way fixing a few sketching mistakes, and then lowered the pencil and watched the result. Startled, I didn't stop sketching but did glance toward the alpha who sat not so far away from me. He was glancing at me too and our eyes met. I tensed, realized I was still looking directly into his eyes, and immediately looked away. No one in his right mind looked the alpha in the eyes. It had only two meanings: Challenging the alpha to a dominance/leadership dual which always resulted in the un-alpha part's death, or inviting him to have sex. Since I was still a female, I couldn't help ogling his body for a little bit; ripped muscles evident beneath his tee and jeans, and biceps to die for. His golden skin made him look even more delicious, and his face was so brutally handsome it hurt. Mostly we would see the alpha in occasions like gatherings or balls or something like that. The alpha was still a person, as half-human as every other werewolf, and he obviously needed his time to himself, too. So I decided to keep this tiny bit of info to myself. Melissa Mercer was a fifty-seven-year-old woman with smooth white-blonde hair, silvery eyes and soft paddings. She was also a human doctor in the local hospital, despite being a werewolf herself. Twenty-five years ago, a human man who'd been in a car accident was taken to the hospital. She hadn't been a doctor yet, but she still helped out when he was in need of immediate surgery. After the surgery, Melissa felt the need to keep an eye on him until he got better. They'd looked into each other's eyes for a long time, until the recognition dawned on Melissa. Melissa didn't mind that her mate was human; in a way it was better for her, since she'd always thought werewolves were too aggressive for her. Besides, how could she give her own mate up? It simply wasn't done. Melissa couldn't leave the newborn alone, and took the baby back home. Melissa, my mother, told me this story many times in the past as I grew up. She wanted me to know of my adoption, but she also wanted me to know that it didn't matter if she gave birth to me or someone else did, that I was her baby girl either way. But, unfortunately, it did matter. She was in the kitchen, baking cookies, when I entered the house. she told me as she turned back to her cookies and I poured myself a glass of water. Jeremy, my sister's mate for two years now, was the alpha's personal lawyer (much to my parents' happiness) and mostly he didn't have surprise-meetings like the one he apparently had today. Maybe the alpha's gloomy mood from back in the river turned even gloomier by something. I recalled Aiden's somber face from the riverbank, his aloofness and the way his square jaw was clenched so seriously. He didn't seem like he was getting over a shot to his ego that his best pal hook  woman. I was only nineteen, no longer a juvenile but yet to be a full-grown woman. It took me about half an hour before I was happy with the result of both sketches, and once I was finished with this, I checked my phone for new messages. I had only one and it was from Michelle: Call me ASAP. After a few rings she finally did. Mia was a common friend of ours whose dream was to find her mate until she's twenty, settle down and start spawning babies. It was uncommon for werewolves to recognize each other as mates when before they were anything but. Usually mates find each other by looking into each other's eyes and recognize the other person as his/her mate, like my parents, like my sister and her mate. Even lovers who turned out to be mates after a certain amount of time they were together was more common than what had happened to Mia. See, Mia and Harry had a completely platonic friendship. That they turned out to be mates. . . The Mating Season was almost here, every werewolf could sense it now, that it was only a matter of days. Michelle had a partner to pass this Season. So did Mia, apparently, and my other friends. I was the only one who didn't arrange herself anyone. Tall, dark and sexy, he was everything a girl couldn't resist. Every human and werewolf turned their head and followed him with their stares, males with begrudging acknowledgement, some with admiration, and females with lust, hunger and unhidden invitation. But Aiden never took the willing females into his bed; he rejected so many of them, from the ugliest to the prettiest, until people started to think he might have a secret mate. . . or that he's gay. But those were just the wounded females who though so; no alpha in the world could be gay; it simply wasn't in their archaic instincts. Work, family and friends could sometimes be too overwhelming, especially the latter. We were on the brink of the Mating Season, an unpredictable period that comes once or twice a year and makes every werewolf in the world crazed with lust, aka the Haze, which resulted in werewolves from age sixteen onward to crave sex with his/her mate, but if a werewolf doesn't find the mate or is still young enough to actually make the act of mating, he/she finds another willing, available partner to mess around during the Season until it finally ends and the Haze is gone. Therefore, there's no male or female werewolf after the age of sixteen who's a virgin. Michelle, my best friend, wanted me to find myself a fuck-buddy too, and she didn't tire of trying; she set me up with three of her brother's friends, and while they seemed perfectly decent and were blunt that they thought me fit for a good time in the sack, I turned them down. I was the only virgin she-wolf after the age of sixteen. At nineteen, I'd been through six Mating Seasons and hadn't had my virginity taken, no matter how sex-crazed I had been. It was very un-wolf-y of me to want to have sex for the first time with someone I cared about, since wolves didn't treat virginity the same way humans did. Deep inside the central park, the river was a quiet place were only the sound of the trickling water broke the silence. I could sit there on the grass, inches away from the water itself, and watch the flowing water for hours. It was a secret place none of my friends and family knew about. He seemed to be lost in thoughts, his face gloomy and serious and his greenish-gold eyes a little glazed.

Melissa Mercer was a fifty-seven-year-old woman with smooth white-blonde hair, silvery eyes and soft paddings. She was also a human doctor in the local hospital, despite being a werewolf herself. Twenty-five years ago, a human man who'd been in a car accident was taken to the hospital. She hadn't been a doctor yet, but she still helped out when he was in need of immediate surgery. After the surgery, Melissa felt the need to keep an eye on him until he got better. They'd looked into each other's eyes for a long time, until the recognition dawned on Melissa. Melissa didn't mind that her mate was human; in a way it was better for her, since she'd always thought werewolves were too aggressive for her. Besides, how could she give her own mate up? It simply wasn't done. Melissa couldn't leave the newborn alone, and took the baby back home. Melissa, my mother, told me this story many times in the past as I grew up. She wanted me to know of my adoption, but she also wanted me to know that it didn't matter if she gave birth to me or someone else did, that I was her baby girl either way. But, unfortunately, it did matter. She was in the kitchen, baking cookies, when I entered the house. she told me as she turned back to her cookies and I poured myself a glass of water. Jeremy, my sister's mate for two years now, was the alpha's personal lawyer (much to my parents' happiness) and mostly he didn't have surprise-meetings like the one he apparently had today. Maybe the alpha's gloomy mood from back in the river turned even gloomier by something. I recalled Aiden's somber face from the riverbank, his aloofness and the way his square jaw was clenched so seriously. He didn't seem like he was getting over a shot to his ego that his best pal hook  woman. I was only nineteen, no longer a juvenile but yet to be a full-grown woman. It took me about half an hour before I was happy with the result of both sketches, and once I was finished with this, I checked my phone for new messages. I had only one and it was from Michelle: Call me ASAP. After a few rings she finally did. Mia was a common friend of ours whose dream was to find her mate until she's twenty, settle down and start spawning babies. It was uncommon for werewolves to recognize each other as mates when before they were anything but. Usually mates find each other by looking into each other's eyes and recognize the other person as his/her mate, like my parents, like my sister and her mate. Even lovers who turned out to be mates after a certain amount of time they were together was more common than what had happened to Mia. See, Mia and Harry had a completely platonic friendship. That they turned out to be mates. . . The Mating Season was almost here, every werewolf could sense it now, that it was only a matter of days. Michelle had a partner to pass this Season. So did Mia, apparently, and my other friends. I was the only one who didn't arrange herself anyone. Tall, dark and sexy, he was everything a girl couldn't resist. Every human and werewolf turned their head and followed him with their stares, males with begrudging acknowledgement, some with admiration, and females with lust, hunger and unhidden invitation. But Aiden never took the willing females into his bed; he rejected so many of them, from the ugliest to the prettiest, until people started to think he might have a secret mate. . . or that he's gay. But those were just the wounded females who though so; no alpha in the world could be gay; it simply wasn't in their archaic instincts. Work, family and friends could sometimes be too overwhelming, especially the latter. We were on the brink of the Mating Season, an unpredictable period that comes once or twice a year and makes every werewolf in the world crazed with lust, aka the Haze, which resulted in werewolves from age sixteen onward to crave sex with his/her mate, but if a werewolf doesn't find the mate or is still young enough to actually make the act of mating, he/she finds another willing, available partner to mess around during the Season until it finally ends and the Haze is gone. Therefore, there's no male or female werewolf after the age of sixteen who's a virgin. Michelle, my best friend, wanted me to find myself a fuck-buddy too, and she didn't tire of trying; she set me up with three of her brother's friends, and while they seemed perfectly decent and were blunt that they thought me fit for a good time in the sack, I turned them down. I was the only virgin she-wolf after the age of sixteen. At nineteen, I'd been through six Mating Seasons and hadn't had my virginity taken, no matter how sex-crazed I had been. It was very un-wolf-y of me to want to have sex for the first time with someone I cared about, since wolves didn't treat virginity the same way humans did. Deep inside the central park, the river was a quiet place were only the sound of the trickling water broke the silence. I could sit there on the grass, inches away from the water itself, and watch the flowing water for hours. It was a secret place none of my friends and family knew about. He seemed to be lost in thoughts, his face gloomy and serious and his greenish-gold eyes a little glazed. His jet-black hair was disheveled, almost as if he'd been in bed before coming here and didn't bother taking a look at it and from his profile, I could see that one dark lock fell into his face. He didn't seem to notice. What was he doing here, of all the places in the city? Didn't he have alpha-related things to do? It was Tuesday, after all. A regular working day, even for the alpha, who had his own daily duties, like helping the innocent and doing things for the greater good for his pack members. Maybe he was taking a break of everything, just like I did. I took out of my bag my sketch notebook and a pencil. Looking for a few more moments at the river, I started absentmindedly sketching the outlines of the riverbank. It didn't require thinking too much, and I turned my mind into automatic-pilot mode. Of course they thought I was an amazing artist, but making a job out of it wasn't on their agenda. They wanted me to do something , like being a lawyer. That's why they'd sent me to Law school right after high school, which I dropped out of after a month because I knew it wasn't my destiny to become a lawyer. They were furious with me, telling me that from being an artist I wouldn't see a dollar, but I refused to listen to them. They also thought they knew what's best for my older sister, Selene, who instead of becoming a lawyer became a fashion designer – and was goddamn good at it. Unfortunately, though, my parents hadn't learned the lesson with her. But just on this one, screw them. Now it was time for shadows. I did that, along the way fixing a few sketching mistakes, and then lowered the pencil and watched the result. Startled, I didn't stop sketching but did glance toward the alpha who sat not so far away from me. He was glancing at me too and our eyes met. I tensed, realized I was still looking directly into his eyes, and immediately looked away. No one in his right mind looked the alpha in the eyes. It had only two meanings: Challenging the alpha to a dominance/leadership dual which always resulted in the un-alpha part's death, or inviting him to have sex. Since I was still a female, I couldn't help ogling his body for a little bit; ripped muscles evident beneath his tee and jeans, and biceps to die for. His golden skin made him look even more delicious, and his face was so brutally handsome it hurt. Mostly we would see the alpha in occasions like gatherings or balls or something like that.

Even lovers who turned out to be mates after a certain amount of time they were together was more common than what had happened to Mia. See, Mia and Harry had a completely platonic friendship. That they turned out to be mates. . . The Mating Season was almost here, every werewolf could sense it now, that it was only a matter of days. Michelle had a partner to pass this Season. So did Mia, apparently, and my other friends. I was the only one who didn't arrange herself anyone. Tall, dark and sexy, he was everything a girl couldn't resist. Every human and werewolf turned their head and followed him with their stares, males with begrudging acknowledgement, some with admiration, and females with lust, hunger and unhidden invitation. But Aiden never took the willing females into his bed; he rejected so many of them, from the ugliest to the prettiest, until people started to think he might have a secret mate. . . or that he's gay. But those were just the wounded females who though so; no alpha in the world could be gay; it simply wasn't in their archaic instincts. Work, family and friends could sometimes be too overwhelming, especially the latter. We were on the brink of the Mating Season, an unpredictable period that comes once or twice a year and makes every werewolf in the world crazed with lust, aka the Haze, which resulted in werewolves from age sixteen onward to crave sex with his/her mate, but if a werewolf doesn't find the mate or is still young enough to actually make the act of mating, he/she finds another willing, available partner to mess around during the Season until it finally ends and the Haze is gone. Therefore, there's no male or female werewolf after the age of sixteen who's a virgin. Michelle, my best friend, wanted me to find myself a fuck-buddy too, and she didn't tire of trying; she set me up with three of her brother's friends, and while they seemed perfectly decent and were blunt that they thought me fit for a good time in the sack, I turned them down. I was the only virgin she-wolf after the age of sixteen. At nineteen, I'd been through six Mating Seasons and hadn't had my virginity taken, no matter how sex-crazed I had been. It was very un-wolf-y of me to want to have sex for the first time with someone I cared about, since wolves didn't treat virginity the same way humans did. Deep inside the central park, the river was a quiet place were only the sound of the trickling water broke the silence. I could sit there on the grass, inches away from the water itself, and watch the flowing water for hours. It was a secret place none of my friends and family knew about. He seemed to be lost in thoughts, his face gloomy and serious and his greenish-gold eyes a little glazed. His jet-black hair was disheveled, almost as if he'd been in bed before coming here and didn't bother taking a look at it and from his profile, I could see that one dark lock fell into his face. He didn't seem to notice. What was he doing here, of all the places in the city? Didn't he have alpha-related things to do? It was Tuesday, after all. A regular working day, even for the alpha, who had his own daily duties, like helping the innocent and doing things for the greater good for his pack members. Maybe he was taking a break of everything, just like I did. I took out of my bag my sketch notebook and a pencil. Looking for a few more moments at the river, I started absentmindedly sketching the outlines of the riverbank. It didn't require thinking too much, and I turned my mind into automatic-pilot mode. Of course they thought I was an amazing artist, but making a job out of it wasn't on their agenda. They wanted me to do something , like being a lawyer. That's why they'd sent me to Law school right after high school, which I dropped out of after a month because I knew it wasn't my destiny to become a lawyer. They were furious with me, telling me that from being an artist I wouldn't see a dollar, but I refused to listen to them. They also thought they knew what's best for my older sister, Selene, who instead of becoming a lawyer became a fashion designer – and was goddamn good at it. Unfortunately, though, my parents hadn't learned the lesson with her. But just on this one, screw them. Now it was time for shadows. I did that, along the way fixing a few sketching mistakes, and then lowered the pencil and watched the result. Startled, I didn't stop sketching but did glance toward the alpha who sat not so far away from me. He was glancing at me too and our eyes met. I tensed, realized I was still looking directly into his eyes, and immediately looked away. No one in his right mind looked the alpha in the eyes. It had only two meanings: Challenging the alpha to a dominance/leadership dual which always resulted in the un-alpha part's death, or inviting him to have sex. Since I was still a female, I couldn't help ogling his body for a little bit; ripped muscles evident beneath his tee and jeans, and biceps to die for. His golden skin made him look even more delicious, and his face was so brutally handsome it hurt. Mostly we would see the alpha in occasions like gatherings or balls or something like that. The alpha was still a person, as half-human as every other werewolf, and he obviously needed his time to himself, too. So I decided to keep this tiny bit of info to myself. Melissa Mercer was a fifty-seven-year-old woman with smooth white-blonde hair, silvery eyes and soft paddings. She was also a human doctor in the local hospital, despite being a werewolf herself. Twenty-five years ago, a human man who'd been in a car accident was taken to the hospital. She hadn't been a doctor yet, but she still helped out when he was in need of immediate surgery. After the surgery, Melissa felt the need to keep an eye on him until he got better. They'd looked into each other's eyes for a long time, until the recognition dawned on Melissa. Melissa didn't mind that her mate was human; in a way it was better for her, since she'd always thought werewolves were too aggressive for her. Besides, how could she give her own mate up? It simply wasn't done. Melissa couldn't leave the newborn alone, and took the baby back home. Melissa, my mother, told me this story many times in the past as I grew up. She wanted me to know of my adoption, but she also wanted me to know that it didn't matter if she gave birth to me or someone else did, that I was her baby girl either way. But, unfortunately, it did matter. She was in the kitchen, baking cookies, when I entered the house. she told me as she turned back to her cookies and I poured myself a glass of water. Jeremy, my sister's mate for two years now, was the alpha's personal lawyer (much to my parents' happiness) and mostly he didn't have surprise-meetings like the one he apparently had today. Maybe the alpha's gloomy mood from back in the river turned even gloomier by something. I recalled Aiden's somber face from the riverbank, his aloofness and the way his square jaw was clenched so seriously. He didn't seem like he was getting over a shot to his ego that his best pal hook  woman. I was only nineteen, no longer a juvenile but yet to be a full-grown woman. It took me about half an hour before I was happy with the result of both sketches, and once I was finished with this, I checked my phone for new messages. I had only one and it was from Michelle: Call me ASAP. After a few rings she finally did. Mia was a common friend of ours whose dream was to find her mate until she's twenty, settle down and start spawning babies.

He seemed to be lost in thoughts, his face gloomy and serious and his greenish-gold eyes a little glazed. His jet-black hair was disheveled, almost as if he'd been in bed before coming here and didn't bother taking a look at it and from his profile, I could see that one dark lock fell into his face. He didn't seem to notice. What was he doing here, of all the places in the city? Didn't he have alpha-related things to do? It was Tuesday, after all. A regular working day, even for the alpha, who had his own daily duties, like helping the innocent and doing things for the greater good for his pack members. Maybe he was taking a break of everything, just like I did. I took out of my bag my sketch notebook and a pencil. Looking for a few more moments at the river, I started absentmindedly sketching the outlines of the riverbank. It didn't require thinking too much, and I turned my mind into automatic-pilot mode. Of course they thought I was an amazing artist, but making a job out of it wasn't on their agenda. They wanted me to do something , like being a lawyer. That's why they'd sent me to Law school right after high school, which I dropped out of after a month because I knew it wasn't my destiny to become a lawyer. They were furious with me, telling me that from being an artist I wouldn't see a dollar, but I refused to listen to them. They also thought they knew what's best for my older sister, Selene, who instead of becoming a lawyer became a fashion designer – and was goddamn good at it. Unfortunately, though, my parents hadn't learned the lesson with her. But just on this one, screw them. Now it was time for shadows. I did that, along the way fixing a few sketching mistakes, and then lowered the pencil and watched the result. Startled, I didn't stop sketching but did glance toward the alpha who sat not so far away from me. He was glancing at me too and our eyes met. I tensed, realized I was still looking directly into his eyes, and immediately looked away. No one in his right mind looked the alpha in the eyes. It had only two meanings: Challenging the alpha to a dominance/leadership dual which always resulted in the un-alpha part's death, or inviting him to have sex. Since I was still a female, I couldn't help ogling his body for a little bit; ripped muscles evident beneath his tee and jeans, and biceps to die for. His golden skin made him look even more delicious, and his face was so brutally handsome it hurt. Mostly we would see the alpha in occasions like gatherings or balls or something like that. The alpha was still a person, as half-human as every other werewolf, and he obviously needed his time to himself, too. So I decided to keep this tiny bit of info to myself. Melissa Mercer was a fifty-seven-year-old woman with smooth white-blonde hair, silvery eyes and soft paddings. She was also a human doctor in the local hospital, despite being a werewolf herself. Twenty-five years ago, a human man who'd been in a car accident was taken to the hospital. She hadn't been a doctor yet, but she still helped out when he was in need of immediate surgery. After the surgery, Melissa felt the need to keep an eye on him until he got better. They'd looked into each other's eyes for a long time, until the recognition dawned on Melissa. Melissa didn't mind that her mate was human; in a way it was better for her, since she'd always thought werewolves were too aggressive for her. Besides, how could she give her own mate up? It simply wasn't done. Melissa couldn't leave the newborn alone, and took the baby back home. Melissa, my mother, told me this story many times in the past as I grew up. She wanted me to know of my adoption, but she also wanted me to know that it didn't matter if she gave birth to me or someone else did, that I was her baby girl either way. But, unfortunately, it did matter. She was in the kitchen, baking cookies, when I entered the house. she told me as she turned back to her cookies and I poured myself a glass of water. Jeremy, my sister's mate for two years now, was the alpha's personal lawyer (much to my parents' happiness) and mostly he didn't have surprise-meetings like the one he apparently had today. Maybe the alpha's gloomy mood from back in the river turned even gloomier by something. I recalled Aiden's somber face from the riverbank, his aloofness and the way his square jaw was clenched so seriously. He didn't seem like he was getting over a shot to his ego that his best pal hook  woman. I was only nineteen, no longer a juvenile but yet to be a full-grown woman. It took me about half an hour before I was happy with the result of both sketches, and once I was finished with this, I checked my phone for new messages. I had only one and it was from Michelle: Call me ASAP. After a few rings she finally did. Mia was a common friend of ours whose dream was to find her mate until she's twenty, settle down and start spawning babies. It was uncommon for werewolves to recognize each other as mates when before they were anything but. Usually mates find each other by looking into each other's eyes and recognize the other person as his/her mate, like my parents, like my sister and her mate. Even lovers who turned out to be mates after a certain amount of time they were together was more common than what had happened to Mia. See, Mia and Harry had a completely platonic friendship. That they turned out to be mates. . . The Mating Season was almost here, every werewolf could sense it now, that it was only a matter of days. Michelle had a partner to pass this Season. So did Mia, apparently, and my other friends. I was the only one who didn't arrange herself anyone. Tall, dark and sexy, he was everything a girl couldn't resist. Every human and werewolf turned their head and followed him with their stares, males with begrudging acknowledgement, some with admiration, and females with lust, hunger and unhidden invitation. But Aiden never took the willing females into his bed; he rejected so many of them, from the ugliest to the prettiest, until people started to think he might have a secret mate. . . or that he's gay. But those were just the wounded females who though so; no alpha in the world could be gay; it simply wasn't in their archaic instincts. Work, family and friends could sometimes be too overwhelming, especially the latter. We were on the brink of the Mating Season, an unpredictable period that comes once or twice a year and makes every werewolf in the world crazed with lust, aka the Haze, which resulted in werewolves from age sixteen onward to crave sex with his/her mate, but if a werewolf doesn't find the mate or is still young enough to actually make the act of mating, he/she finds another willing, available partner to mess around during the Season until it finally ends and the Haze is gone. Therefore, there's no male or female werewolf after the age of sixteen who's a virgin. Michelle, my best friend, wanted me to find myself a fuck-buddy too, and she didn't tire of trying; she set me up with three of her brother's friends, and while they seemed perfectly decent and were blunt that they thought me fit for a good time in the sack, I turned them down. I was the only virgin she-wolf after the age of sixteen. At nineteen, I'd been through six Mating Seasons and hadn't had my virginity taken, no matter how sex-crazed I had been. It was very un-wolf-y of me to want to have sex for the first time with someone I cared about, since wolves didn't treat virginity the same way humans did.

The alpha was still a person, as half-human as every other werewolf, and he obviously needed his time to himself, too. So I decided to keep this tiny bit of info to myself. Melissa Mercer was a fifty-seven-year-old woman with smooth white-blonde hair, silvery eyes and soft paddings. She was also a human doctor in the local hospital, despite being a werewolf herself. Twenty-five years ago, a human man who'd been in a car accident was taken to the hospital. She hadn't been a doctor yet, but she still helped out when he was in need of immediate surgery. After the surgery, Melissa felt the need to keep an eye on him until he got better. They'd looked into each other's eyes for a long time, until the recognition dawned on Melissa. Melissa didn't mind that her mate was human; in a way it was better for her, since she'd always thought werewolves were too aggressive for her. Besides, how could she give her own mate up? It simply wasn't done. Melissa couldn't leave the newborn alone, and took the baby back home. Melissa, my mother, told me this story many times in the past as I grew up. She wanted me to know of my adoption, but she also wanted me to know that it didn't matter if she gave birth to me or someone else did, that I was her baby girl either way. But, unfortunately, it did matter. She was in the kitchen, baking cookies, when I entered the house. she told me as she turned back to her cookies and I poured myself a glass of water. Jeremy, my sister's mate for two years now, was the alpha's personal lawyer (much to my parents' happiness) and mostly he didn't have surprise-meetings like the one he apparently had today. Maybe the alpha's gloomy mood from back in the river turned even gloomier by something. I recalled Aiden's somber face from the riverbank, his aloofness and the way his square jaw was clenched so seriously. He didn't seem like he was getting over a shot to his ego that his best pal hook  woman. I was only nineteen, no longer a juvenile but yet to be a full-grown woman. It took me about half an hour before I was happy with the result of both sketches, and once I was finished with this, I checked my phone for new messages. I had only one and it was from Michelle: Call me ASAP. After a few rings she finally did. Mia was a common friend of ours whose dream was to find her mate until she's twenty, settle down and start spawning babies. It was uncommon for werewolves to recognize each other as mates when before they were anything but. Usually mates find each other by looking into each other's eyes and recognize the other person as his/her mate, like my parents, like my sister and her mate. Even lovers who turned out to be mates after a certain amount of time they were together was more common than what had happened to Mia. See, Mia and Harry had a completely platonic friendship. That they turned out to be mates. . . The Mating Season was almost here, every werewolf could sense it now, that it was only a matter of days. Michelle had a partner to pass this Season. So did Mia, apparently, and my other friends. I was the only one who didn't arrange herself anyone.
