The headmaster of the prestigious Crestan High School peered over his frames at the small boy sitting in front of him. A rosy, rounded man, his seat creaked painfully as he shifted. Finnigan frowned. The principal sighed. Lord, he sounded devastated. Sam Westlane's head shot up and he eagerly thanked the headmaster. She smiled to herself. Sam shook her head and breathed deeply. Yes, everything is finally going to change. Then she looked down again and pressed her hands down her clothes, fluffing her father's old shirt to ensure that it was loose around her small chest, which she had tried to bind down anyway with some old bandages she'd stolen from her uncle's medicine cabinet. A tall boy her age looked up, startled. She leaned on the door and covered her face embarrassedly. Mouth agape, she spun around and apologized profusely again. The boy nodded, wringing his hands together and keeping his eyes downcast. It was well known throughout the campus that the student body was divided into two major sections: either you were on Vincent Grenford's side or you were against him -namely, on his rival, Tristan Harland's side. Sam stared bewilderedly as the door closed behind the tall, handsome boy. Vincent mused. Vincent tossed the ball back to Jack.

David Weston: the rich, arrogant playboy who thinks the world revolves around him. Madison Harper: the school golden girl. Ian Hart: the hottie next door. Scott Manning: the badass player. It's their final year at Maple Ridge Academy. Yeah, normally this question involves a tree, I'm aware of that. Okay, first off, no, I'm not insane (though a certain track star would beg to differ, but he's an ass, so really, who gives a damn what he says? My name? Spade. So, who am I? There's Madison Harper, my roommate of three years so far, and one of my best friends. Then there's Ian Hart. And have I mentioned what a cutie he is? To tell the truth, I don't particularly like my stepfather all that much (I guess that's not really uncommon), and I don't particularly like the kind of person my mother turned into. But Amanda? We both have the same skin tone (whereas mine is natural – parents are Guyanese, holla – Scott's comes from a tan made by years and years spent vacationing in Maui or the Dominican, wherever the happening vacation spot for the rich is these days), the same thick dark hair, the same dark eyes… we even have the same sort of build, only I'm more, ah, feminine. Our mutual love for the show is what actually brought us together (it's so corny, I know). So… where was I, again? Dear, dear Amanda got to stay at home in Toronto and continue to go to public school. I'm just kind of sad for Alan, since this is my and Scott's last year at Maple (last year was supposed to be Scott's last year, but the idiot had to go and skip half his classes and fail the year, so the school faculty so graciously allowed him to repeat his senior year with me… after Adam 'donated' a couple hundred grand, of course). Let me make it clear right now: I abhor David. See, my first day at school, he hit on me (I'd barely stepped foot out of the taxi). Anyways, I'm off-topic again. Point is, I can see why girls think he's so hot (he's another one of the campus hotties, by the way). Okay. Which brings me to the day I went back to school, the weekend before classes began. Right. I resisted the urge to roll my eyes, and continued packing away my clothes into my closet. Madison grinned and leapt off the bed, rushing towards the window to open it up. I sighed, not exactly happy about the idea of Weston spending the next hour in my room, on my bed. I winced at the mentioning of my name. See, contrary to what people think, I don't enjoy arguing with Weston. Remember how I said those two have been friends since diapers? I cracked, frowning when I realized that the book in my hand belonged on the topmost shelf. Scott burst out laughing. Weston raised an eyebrow suggestively. A string of loud curses flew from his mouth. Samantha Spade: the quiet, witty, extremely sarcastic one. David Weston: the rich, arrogant playboy who thinks the world revolves around him.

Our mutual love for the show is what actually brought us together (it's so corny, I know). So… where was I, again? Dear, dear Amanda got to stay at home in Toronto and continue to go to public school. I'm just kind of sad for Alan, since this is my and Scott's last year at Maple (last year was supposed to be Scott's last year, but the idiot had to go and skip half his classes and fail the year, so the school faculty so graciously allowed him to repeat his senior year with me… after Adam 'donated' a couple hundred grand, of course). Let me make it clear right now: I abhor David. See, my first day at school, he hit on me (I'd barely stepped foot out of the taxi). Anyways, I'm off-topic again. Point is, I can see why girls think he's so hot (he's another one of the campus hotties, by the way). Okay. Which brings me to the day I went back to school, the weekend before classes began. Right. I resisted the urge to roll my eyes, and continued packing away my clothes into my closet. Madison grinned and leapt off the bed, rushing towards the window to open it up. I sighed, not exactly happy about the idea of Weston spending the next hour in my room, on my bed. I winced at the mentioning of my name. See, contrary to what people think, I don't enjoy arguing with Weston. Remember how I said those two have been friends since diapers? I cracked, frowning when I realized that the book in my hand belonged on the topmost shelf. Scott burst out laughing. Weston raised an eyebrow suggestively. A string of loud curses flew from his mouth. Samantha Spade: the quiet, witty, extremely sarcastic one. David Weston: the rich, arrogant playboy who thinks the world revolves around him. Madison Harper: the school golden girl. Ian Hart: the hottie next door. Scott Manning: the badass player. It's their final year at Maple Ridge Academy. Yeah, normally this question involves a tree, I'm aware of that. Okay, first off, no, I'm not insane (though a certain track star would beg to differ, but he's an ass, so really, who gives a damn what he says? My name? Spade. So, who am I? There's Madison Harper, my roommate of three years so far, and one of my best friends. Then there's Ian Hart. And have I mentioned what a cutie he is?

I cracked, frowning when I realized that the book in my hand belonged on the topmost shelf. Scott burst out laughing. Weston raised an eyebrow suggestively. A string of loud curses flew from his mouth. Samantha Spade: the quiet, witty, extremely sarcastic one. David Weston: the rich, arrogant playboy who thinks the world revolves around him. Madison Harper: the school golden girl. Ian Hart: the hottie next door. Scott Manning: the badass player. It's their final year at Maple Ridge Academy. Yeah, normally this question involves a tree, I'm aware of that. Okay, first off, no, I'm not insane (though a certain track star would beg to differ, but he's an ass, so really, who gives a damn what he says? My name? Spade. So, who am I? There's Madison Harper, my roommate of three years so far, and one of my best friends. Then there's Ian Hart. And have I mentioned what a cutie he is? To tell the truth, I don't particularly like my stepfather all that much (I guess that's not really uncommon), and I don't particularly like the kind of person my mother turned into. But Amanda? We both have the same skin tone (whereas mine is natural – parents are Guyanese, holla – Scott's comes from a tan made by years and years spent vacationing in Maui or the Dominican, wherever the happening vacation spot for the rich is these days), the same thick dark hair, the same dark eyes… we even have the same sort of build, only I'm more, ah, feminine. Our mutual love for the show is what actually brought us together (it's so corny, I know). So… where was I, again? Dear, dear Amanda got to stay at home in Toronto and continue to go to public school. I'm just kind of sad for Alan, since this is my and Scott's last year at Maple (last year was supposed to be Scott's last year, but the idiot had to go and skip half his classes and fail the year, so the school faculty so graciously allowed him to repeat his senior year with me… after Adam 'donated' a couple hundred grand, of course). Let me make it clear right now: I abhor David. See, my first day at school, he hit on me (I'd barely stepped foot out of the taxi). Anyways, I'm off-topic again. Point is, I can see why girls think he's so hot (he's another one of the campus hotties, by the way). Okay. Which brings me to the day I went back to school, the weekend before classes began. Right. I resisted the urge to roll my eyes, and continued packing away my clothes into my closet. Madison grinned and leapt off the bed, rushing towards the window to open it up.

I'm just kind of sad for Alan, since this is my and Scott's last year at Maple (last year was supposed to be Scott's last year, but the idiot had to go and skip half his classes and fail the year, so the school faculty so graciously allowed him to repeat his senior year with me… after Adam 'donated' a couple hundred grand, of course). Let me make it clear right now: I abhor David. See, my first day at school, he hit on me (I'd barely stepped foot out of the taxi). Anyways, I'm off-topic again. Point is, I can see why girls think he's so hot (he's another one of the campus hotties, by the way). Okay. Which brings me to the day I went back to school, the weekend before classes began. Right. I resisted the urge to roll my eyes, and continued packing away my clothes into my closet. Madison grinned and leapt off the bed, rushing towards the window to open it up. I sighed, not exactly happy about the idea of Weston spending the next hour in my room, on my bed. I winced at the mentioning of my name. See, contrary to what people think, I don't enjoy arguing with Weston. Remember how I said those two have been friends since diapers? I cracked, frowning when I realized that the book in my hand belonged on the topmost shelf. Scott burst out laughing. Weston raised an eyebrow suggestively. A string of loud curses flew from his mouth. The headmaster of the prestigious Crestan High School peered over his frames at the small boy sitting in front of him. A rosy, rounded man, his seat creaked painfully as he shifted. Finnigan frowned. The principal sighed. Lord, he sounded devastated. Sam Westlane's head shot up and he eagerly thanked the headmaster. She smiled to herself. Sam shook her head and breathed deeply. Yes, everything is finally going to change. Then she looked down again and pressed her hands down her clothes, fluffing her father's old shirt to ensure that it was loose around her small chest, which she had tried to bind down anyway with some old bandages she'd stolen from her uncle's medicine cabinet. A tall boy her age looked up, startled. She leaned on the door and covered her face embarrassedly. Mouth agape, she spun around and apologized profusely again. The boy nodded, wringing his hands together and keeping his eyes downcast. It was well known throughout the campus that the student body was divided into two major sections: either you were on Vincent Grenford's side or you were against him -namely, on his rival, Tristan Harland's side. Sam stared bewilderedly as the door closed behind the tall, handsome boy. Vincent mused. Vincent tossed the ball back to Jack.

David Weston: the rich, arrogant playboy who thinks the world revolves around him. Madison Harper: the school golden girl. Ian Hart: the hottie next door. Scott Manning: the badass player. It's their final year at Maple Ridge Academy. Yeah, normally this question involves a tree, I'm aware of that. Okay, first off, no, I'm not insane (though a certain track star would beg to differ, but he's an ass, so really, who gives a damn what he says? My name? Spade. So, who am I? There's Madison Harper, my roommate of three years so far, and one of my best friends. Then there's Ian Hart. And have I mentioned what a cutie he is? To tell the truth, I don't particularly like my stepfather all that much (I guess that's not really uncommon), and I don't particularly like the kind of person my mother turned into. But Amanda? We both have the same skin tone (whereas mine is natural – parents are Guyanese, holla – Scott's comes from a tan made by years and years spent vacationing in Maui or the Dominican, wherever the happening vacation spot for the rich is these days), the same thick dark hair, the same dark eyes… we even have the same sort of build, only I'm more, ah, feminine. Our mutual love for the show is what actually brought us together (it's so corny, I know). So… where was I, again?

See, contrary to what people think, I don't enjoy arguing with Weston. Remember how I said those two have been friends since diapers? I cracked, frowning when I realized that the book in my hand belonged on the topmost shelf. Scott burst out laughing. Weston raised an eyebrow suggestively. A string of loud curses flew from his mouth. Samantha Spade: the quiet, witty, extremely sarcastic one. David Weston: the rich, arrogant playboy who thinks the world revolves around him. Madison Harper: the school golden girl. Ian Hart: the hottie next door. Scott Manning: the badass player. It's their final year at Maple Ridge Academy. Yeah, normally this question involves a tree, I'm aware of that. Okay, first off, no, I'm not insane (though a certain track star would beg to differ, but he's an ass, so really, who gives a damn what he says? My name? Spade. So, who am I? There's Madison Harper, my roommate of three years so far, and one of my best friends. Then there's Ian Hart. And have I mentioned what a cutie he is? To tell the truth, I don't particularly like my stepfather all that much (I guess that's not really uncommon), and I don't particularly like the kind of person my mother turned into. But Amanda? We both have the same skin tone (whereas mine is natural – parents are Guyanese, holla – Scott's comes from a tan made by years and years spent vacationing in Maui or the Dominican, wherever the happening vacation spot for the rich is these days), the same thick dark hair, the same dark eyes… we even have the same sort of build, only I'm more, ah, feminine. Our mutual love for the show is what actually brought us together (it's so corny, I know). So… where was I, again? Dear, dear Amanda got to stay at home in Toronto and continue to go to public school. I'm just kind of sad for Alan, since this is my and Scott's last year at Maple (last year was supposed to be Scott's last year, but the idiot had to go and skip half his classes and fail the year, so the school faculty so graciously allowed him to repeat his senior year with me… after Adam 'donated' a couple hundred grand, of course). Let me make it clear right now: I abhor David. See, my first day at school, he hit on me (I'd barely stepped foot out of the taxi). Anyways, I'm off-topic again. Point is, I can see why girls think he's so hot (he's another one of the campus hotties, by the way). Okay. Which brings me to the day I went back to school, the weekend before classes began. Right.

Our mutual love for the show is what actually brought us together (it's so corny, I know). So… where was I, again? Dear, dear Amanda got to stay at home in Toronto and continue to go to public school. I'm just kind of sad for Alan, since this is my and Scott's last year at Maple (last year was supposed to be Scott's last year, but the idiot had to go and skip half his classes and fail the year, so the school faculty so graciously allowed him to repeat his senior year with me… after Adam 'donated' a couple hundred grand, of course). Let me make it clear right now: I abhor David. See, my first day at school, he hit on me (I'd barely stepped foot out of the taxi). Anyways, I'm off-topic again. Point is, I can see why girls think he's so hot (he's another one of the campus hotties, by the way). Okay. Which brings me to the day I went back to school, the weekend before classes began. Right. I resisted the urge to roll my eyes, and continued packing away my clothes into my closet. Madison grinned and leapt off the bed, rushing towards the window to open it up. I sighed, not exactly happy about the idea of Weston spending the next hour in my room, on my bed. I winced at the mentioning of my name. See, contrary to what people think, I don't enjoy arguing with Weston. Remember how I said those two have been friends since diapers? I cracked, frowning when I realized that the book in my hand belonged on the topmost shelf. Scott burst out laughing. Weston raised an eyebrow suggestively. A string of loud curses flew from his mouth. Samantha Spade: the quiet, witty, extremely sarcastic one. David Weston: the rich, arrogant playboy who thinks the world revolves around him. Madison Harper: the school golden girl. Ian Hart: the hottie next door. Scott Manning: the badass player. It's their final year at Maple Ridge Academy. Yeah, normally this question involves a tree, I'm aware of that. Okay, first off, no, I'm not insane (though a certain track star would beg to differ, but he's an ass, so really, who gives a damn what he says? My name? Spade. So, who am I? There's Madison Harper, my roommate of three years so far, and one of my best friends. Then there's Ian Hart. And have I mentioned what a cutie he is?

I cracked, frowning when I realized that the book in my hand belonged on the topmost shelf. Scott burst out laughing. Weston raised an eyebrow suggestively. A string of loud curses flew from his mouth. Samantha Spade: the quiet, witty, extremely sarcastic one. David Weston: the rich, arrogant playboy who thinks the world revolves around him. Madison Harper: the school golden girl. Ian Hart: the hottie next door. Scott Manning: the badass player. It's their final year at Maple Ridge Academy. Yeah, normally this question involves a tree, I'm aware of that. Okay, first off, no, I'm not insane (though a certain track star would beg to differ, but he's an ass, so really, who gives a damn what he says? My name? Spade. So, who am I? There's Madison Harper, my roommate of three years so far, and one of my best friends. Then there's Ian Hart. And have I mentioned what a cutie he is? To tell the truth, I don't particularly like my stepfather all that much (I guess that's not really uncommon), and I don't particularly like the kind of person my mother turned into. But Amanda? We both have the same skin tone (whereas mine is natural – parents are Guyanese, holla – Scott's comes from a tan made by years and years spent vacationing in Maui or the Dominican, wherever the happening vacation spot for the rich is these days), the same thick dark hair, the same dark eyes… we even have the same sort of build, only I'm more, ah, feminine. Our mutual love for the show is what actually brought us together (it's so corny, I know). So… where was I, again? Dear, dear Amanda got to stay at home in Toronto and continue to go to public school. I'm just kind of sad for Alan, since this is my and Scott's last year at Maple (last year was supposed to be Scott's last year, but the idiot had to go and skip half his classes and fail the year, so the school faculty so graciously allowed him to repeat his senior year with me… after Adam 'donated' a couple hundred grand, of course). Let me make it clear right now: I abhor David. See, my first day at school, he hit on me (I'd barely stepped foot out of the taxi). Anyways, I'm off-topic again. Point is, I can see why girls think he's so hot (he's another one of the campus hotties, by the way). Okay. Which brings me to the day I went back to school, the weekend before classes began. Right. I resisted the urge to roll my eyes, and continued packing away my clothes into my closet. Madison grinned and leapt off the bed, rushing towards the window to open it up. I sighed, not exactly happy about the idea of Weston spending the next hour in my room, on my bed. I winced at the mentioning of my name.

A string of loud curses flew from his mouth. Full Summary: Felicia and Brody have been next-door neighbors for a long time. So. I slipped my shirt over my head and cast it aside, avoiding the eyes that were inevitably watching me. See, the boy next door—Brody Hansen—and I, well, we had a system: I didn't like him and he didn't like me, but we both liked watching the other dress and undress. In my bra and underwear, I leaned over to shut my blinds. I put on the rest of my pajamas and shut off the light. You see, I'd lived in that house my whole life. Mrs. Hansen: (laughing) She's precious. You understand? Then I'd be holed up in my room, bored, while Brody drank. The first time Felicia McAdams changed in front of me was when we were in tenth grade. Calm down, her back was facing me. I tried to avert my eyes, but something about her—maybe the fact that she was half-naked—rendered me completely motionless. Whoa, I'd thought. She turned back to me after rummaging in her closet and held up two identical hooded shirts—one green, one blue. Green, I mouthed back immediately. While Felicia pulled her shirt on, I took the opportunity to collect myself. She'd opened her window then, and gestured for me to do the same. Two years later, and I still hadn't seen that girl completely naked. Yes, she was a virgin. I mean, if they broke up, there must have been a reason, mustn't there? I wished I could have a relationship like that. Anyway, I swear Nick was going to be a psycho-analyst when he grew up—which must've been in less than a month. I never missed my dad. Felicia never understood that. Felicia was a virgin then. I sighed, setting down my worn-and-torn copy of The Prisoner of Azkaban, shutting my own blinds and turning off the light.

In my bra and underwear, I leaned over to shut my blinds. I put on the rest of my pajamas and shut off the light. You see, I'd lived in that house my whole life. Mrs. Hansen: (laughing) She's precious. You understand? Then I'd be holed up in my room, bored, while Brody drank. The first time Felicia McAdams changed in front of me was when we were in tenth grade. Calm down, her back was facing me. I tried to avert my eyes, but something about her—maybe the fact that she was half-naked—rendered me completely motionless. Whoa, I'd thought. She turned back to me after rummaging in her closet and held up two identical hooded shirts—one green, one blue. Green, I mouthed back immediately. While Felicia pulled her shirt on, I took the opportunity to collect myself. She'd opened her window then, and gestured for me to do the same. Two years later, and I still hadn't seen that girl completely naked. Yes, she was a virgin. I mean, if they broke up, there must have been a reason, mustn't there? I wished I could have a relationship like that. Anyway, I swear Nick was going to be a psycho-analyst when he grew up—which must've been in less than a month. I never missed my dad. Felicia never understood that. Felicia was a virgin then. I sighed, setting down my worn-and-torn copy of The Prisoner of Azkaban, shutting my own blinds and turning off the light.

A/N: So, what do you think? It had been raining throughout the night, and I could see that the grass had already turned greener, reacting to the rain. I spotted dad in the training circle, trotting a filly around using a lunging rein. Don't get me wrong, I didn't mind at all. I headed back into the house to put on jeans and grab a cap before making my way to my horse, Gypsy's, paddock. After saddling her up I whistled for the two Kelpies, Jip and Pete. The Back Paddock was, naturally, at the very back of the property. On the bright side, they were better than sheep. Kneeling next to the river, I splashed water on my face, groaning in pleasure as the cool water hit my heated face. Fear rushed through me as instinct kicked in – I screamed and jumped away, falling into the river. Standing in front of me was a man. He also couldn't be one of the neighbours, because I would recognise him. I screeched, my mind reeling from shock. He did nothing but hold out a hand to me, and I could see his weird eyes dancing with amusement. Right. That would explain a lot, like the uptight attitude, lack of an accent, and not understanding anything. My eyes instantly narrowed, and I felt anger and frustration building up inside me. He held his hand out, palm upturned. Cupped in his hand was what looked like a globe of fire. I thought long and hard. I pronounced proudly. A/N: (23/06/2012) So I've starting editing this to make it read a lot better. Dapple grey: a colour of horse, usually white and grey with black legs. Both worlds, Leninus and Earth, have progressed a lot, though not in the same way.

I headed back into the house to put on jeans and grab a cap before making my way to my horse, Gypsy's, paddock. After saddling her up I whistled for the two Kelpies, Jip and Pete. The Back Paddock was, naturally, at the very back of the property. On the bright side, they were better than sheep. Kneeling next to the river, I splashed water on my face, groaning in pleasure as the cool water hit my heated face. Fear rushed through me as instinct kicked in – I screamed and jumped away, falling into the river. Standing in front of me was a man. He also couldn't be one of the neighbours, because I would recognise him. I screeched, my mind reeling from shock. He did nothing but hold out a hand to me, and I could see his weird eyes dancing with amusement. Right. That would explain a lot, like the uptight attitude, lack of an accent, and not understanding anything. My eyes instantly narrowed, and I felt anger and frustration building up inside me. He held his hand out, palm upturned. Cupped in his hand was what looked like a globe of fire. I thought long and hard. I pronounced proudly.

This is out of character for me. Then he said  and gave me the said puppy-dog eyes and asked me to forgive him. I know, I know, it's a little disgusting. A year and a half later my blonde baby sister with her big boobs and shiny white teeth stole him. At least that's what I told myself to rationalize what Ryan did. But when I went home and found Carrie texting  it was harder to keep my heart in check. Sleeping was hard that night. I was surprised to find myself biting my tongue to keep back from yelling at him. He grinned at me, a grin that always sent my heart soaring, but it sunk. When class ended he kissed me on the cheek and told me he'd see me later that day. I wasn't going to do anything. I turned sharply, expecting to see Ryan. It wasn't him, thank God. He was leaning against an old BMW with a broken passenger window covered with duct tape. I said, turning on my heel. I tried to act casual. He handed the bat back to me and placed his hand on my shoulder. I think he said this to make me feel better but it didn't. Peter didn't let me walk off. He grinned and placed the cigarette in the pocket on my left breast. What am I getting myself into? I looked at him over the top of my mug of hot chocolate and sighed. he leaned forward, placing his elbows on his knees and fiddling with his pocket watch. I expected Peter to shake his head, or roll his eyes, anything that meant he didn't understand me but wasn't going to say anything. He grabbed my hand, engulfing it in his own. Straight? "Just tell him that you do care, and that he's scum, and you don't want anything to do with him. When he finished he gently shoved my head forward, pushing me away from him. I hadn't even realized I'd begun to cry until he touched me. Butterflies. I didn't have much time left to think about the effect he had on me because out of the corner of my eye I saw Ryan. Uh…yes. I turned to him with a fierce look. I turned on my heel and began to head towards Ryan's car. Peter began to shout  but it was too late. I wiped my forehead with the back of my arm and stared at my work. Bright red. Peter stared at me for a long while before he threw the bat on the ground. I grinned. It was a movie kiss. I broke away from the kiss and Peter leaned forward, still wanting more. Ryan yelled. The color drained from Ryan's face and he took a step back. I've never seen Ryan run faster, even when he was on the track team. Peter rested his head on his shoulder and began to laugh. he said. And for what I swore would be the last time in my life I obeyed a guy and enjoyed the after-effects of my crazy mood.

Then he said  and gave me the said puppy-dog eyes and asked me to forgive him. I know, I know, it's a little disgusting. A year and a half later my blonde baby sister with her big boobs and shiny white teeth stole him. At least that's what I told myself to rationalize what Ryan did. But when I went home and found Carrie texting  it was harder to keep my heart in check. Sleeping was hard that night. I was surprised to find myself biting my tongue to keep back from yelling at him. He grinned at me, a grin that always sent my heart soaring, but it sunk. When class ended he kissed me on the cheek and told me he'd see me later that day. I wasn't going to do anything. I turned sharply, expecting to see Ryan. It wasn't him, thank God. He was leaning against an old BMW with a broken passenger window covered with duct tape. I said, turning on my heel. I tried to act casual. He handed the bat back to me and placed his hand on my shoulder. I think he said this to make me feel better but it didn't. Peter didn't let me walk off. He grinned and placed the cigarette in the pocket on my left breast. What am I getting myself into? I looked at him over the top of my mug of hot chocolate and sighed. he leaned forward, placing his elbows on his knees and fiddling with his pocket watch. I expected Peter to shake his head, or roll his eyes, anything that meant he didn't understand me but wasn't going to say anything. He grabbed my hand, engulfing it in his own. Straight? "Just tell him that you do care, and that he's scum, and you don't want anything to do with him. When he finished he gently shoved my head forward, pushing me away from him. I hadn't even realized I'd begun to cry until he touched me. Butterflies. I didn't have much time left to think about the effect he had on me because out of the corner of my eye I saw Ryan. Uh…yes. I turned to him with a fierce look. I turned on my heel and began to head towards Ryan's car. Peter began to shout  but it was too late. I wiped my forehead with the back of my arm and stared at my work. Bright red. Peter stared at me for a long while before he threw the bat on the ground. I grinned. It was a movie kiss. I broke away from the kiss and Peter leaned forward, still wanting more. Ryan yelled. The color drained from Ryan's face and he took a step back. I've never seen Ryan run faster, even when he was on the track team. Peter rested his head on his shoulder and began to laugh. he said.

I turned to him with a fierce look. I turned on my heel and began to head towards Ryan's car. Peter began to shout  but it was too late. I wiped my forehead with the back of my arm and stared at my work. Bright red. Peter stared at me for a long while before he threw the bat on the ground. I grinned. It was a movie kiss. I broke away from the kiss and Peter leaned forward, still wanting more. Ryan yelled. The color drained from Ryan's face and he took a step back. I've never seen Ryan run faster, even when he was on the track team. Peter rested his head on his shoulder and began to laugh. he said. And for what I swore would be the last time in my life I obeyed a guy and enjoyed the after-effects of my crazy mood. Get Mad, BabyRyan said I was so meek that he didn't even think I would mind if he cheated on me. But I am angry. This is out of character for me. Then he said  and gave me the said puppy-dog eyes and asked me to forgive him. I know, I know, it's a little disgusting. A year and a half later my blonde baby sister with her big boobs and shiny white teeth stole him. At least that's what I told myself to rationalize what Ryan did. But when I went home and found Carrie texting  it was harder to keep my heart in check. Sleeping was hard that night. I was surprised to find myself biting my tongue to keep back from yelling at him. He grinned at me, a grin that always sent my heart soaring, but it sunk. When class ended he kissed me on the cheek and told me he'd see me later that day. I wasn't going to do anything. I turned sharply, expecting to see Ryan. It wasn't him, thank God. He was leaning against an old BMW with a broken passenger window covered with duct tape. I said, turning on my heel. I tried to act casual. He handed the bat back to me and placed his hand on my shoulder. I think he said this to make me feel better but it didn't. Peter didn't let me walk off. He grinned and placed the cigarette in the pocket on my left breast. What am I getting myself into? I looked at him over the top of my mug of hot chocolate and sighed. he leaned forward, placing his elbows on his knees and fiddling with his pocket watch. I expected Peter to shake his head, or roll his eyes, anything that meant he didn't understand me but wasn't going to say anything. He grabbed my hand, engulfing it in his own. Straight? "Just tell him that you do care, and that he's scum, and you don't want anything to do with him. When he finished he gently shoved my head forward, pushing me away from him.

Carrie and Michael finally arrived, sitting down next to me and giggling amongst each other. I greeted him awkwardly. Oh, don't get me wrong. I guess I hadn't been subtle enough, though, because my target was currently staring at me across the room. Though, he did look really good when he was being this happy. Alright, so that was an exaggeration. I looked at him again. Still, I supposed he looked good enough to warrant such a healthy ego. Speaking of whom had turned back to his friend while I was pondering the intricate mysteries of his blue eyes. I said, mostly to myself, because let's face it – the only reason I was sitting on the couch checking out cute blond-haired, blue-eyed guys was because I was at a party alone. Diagnosis was the first step to finding the cure for the sickness. A couple tequila shots later – okay, I lied, I only had one measly shot – I was living it up as the center of attention of the party. That sounded wrong. Whenever one of them glanced back, I would hide myself behind the nearest lamp-post or telephone pole. They let me follow them for as far as the main entrance of Halls of Residence Fourteen. There was the sound of the metal gate opening and I was mentally congratulating myself on a stalk well done when something happened to send my satisfaction down the drain. Sobering up all of a sudden, I sank to the ground. For some reason, Blue Eyes started popping up everywhere I went. I stared at her. And here came the familiar eye-roll. I threw a pillow at her. I said, with a little bit of wonder. His expression as he looked down on me was a mixture of a smile and a frown. Belatedly, I realized his phone had been vibrating. he divulged, smiling just the slightest bit. I said proudly, then paused. He was smiling, though. He grinned. I was kidding, of course. …Maybe. But he didn't seem to mind that I was monopolizing a little bit of his time almost every day. On our third meet-up, I realized we'd never formally introduced ourselves to each other. On one hand, it was cool that he had a nickname for me. Half an hour and a cup of iced latte later, I was a little drunk on coffee. There was a little silence as he digested what I'd just said. He lounged back in his seat, raising his cup to his lips before he remembered that it was empty. Then we went on another one of our tangents. Or maybe, I admitted to myself with a sinking feeling, the hypothetical mystery girl in this case wasn't so hypothetical after all. I said as the two of them stood up to accommodate my arrival. He trailed off, as if he had no idea how to categorize me. I think that was the moment I felt that little bit of hope in my chest shrivel up and die. I looked at Maddy again. Not that I would even want to. Coward. I was trying my hardest not to look up into his eyes. His tone had lightened considerably. Gosh, why was he so persistent? I made to sound like I was giggling, even though I'd never felt less like it in my entire life. I said loftily, knowing this would make him go away. I did an about-turn and went back the way I'd come from. Of course I would be. Moping around the room could hardly be constituted as 'ruining my life'. She didn't agree, judging by the way she ignored me and barreled on. But my heart still wasn't convinced. He'd once told me he hated being out in the rain. Therefore, I was understandably horrified when I rounded the corner and saw him standing outside the gates of Hall Fourteen. Well, this was awkward. I couldn't stand this anymore. I almost fell over in shock. I watched him go. He spoke harshly, stabbing a finger in my direction. He ignored me. I slowly retracted my hand until the underside of the umbrella was touching the top of my head. Maybe I had been superficial. He was glaring at me. Because, ultimately, the most important thing was for him to be happy. I jumped. He ran a palm over his face, looking like he would like nothing better in the world than to strangle some sense into me. I snapped. I admitted grudgingly. I muttered mutinously. It was… the coldest kiss I'd had so far. It wasn't the most passionate, or the most perfect, or the most skilful kiss I'd ever experienced. I discovered I was also drenched by the time we both ran out of breath and pulled away. As it turned out, he didn't need any advice on how to win a girl over, after all. Certain parts of this story are based off true incidents. Oh, don't get me wrong. I guess I hadn't been subtle enough, though, because my target was currently staring at me across the room.

I said, with a little bit of wonder. His expression as he looked down on me was a mixture of a smile and a frown. Belatedly, I realized his phone had been vibrating. he divulged, smiling just the slightest bit. I said proudly, then paused. He was smiling, though. He grinned. I was kidding, of course. …Maybe. But he didn't seem to mind that I was monopolizing a little bit of his time almost every day. On our third meet-up, I realized we'd never formally introduced ourselves to each other. On one hand, it was cool that he had a nickname for me. Half an hour and a cup of iced latte later, I was a little drunk on coffee. There was a little silence as he digested what I'd just said. He lounged back in his seat, raising his cup to his lips before he remembered that it was empty. Then we went on another one of our tangents. Or maybe, I admitted to myself with a sinking feeling, the hypothetical mystery girl in this case wasn't so hypothetical after all. I said as the two of them stood up to accommodate my arrival. He trailed off, as if he had no idea how to categorize me. I think that was the moment I felt that little bit of hope in my chest shrivel up and die. I looked at Maddy again. Not that I would even want to. Coward. I was trying my hardest not to look up into his eyes. His tone had lightened considerably. Gosh, why was he so persistent? I made to sound like I was giggling, even though I'd never felt less like it in my entire life. I said loftily, knowing this would make him go away. I did an about-turn and went back the way I'd come from. Of course I would be. Moping around the room could hardly be constituted as 'ruining my life'. She didn't agree, judging by the way she ignored me and barreled on. But my heart still wasn't convinced. He'd once told me he hated being out in the rain. Therefore, I was understandably horrified when I rounded the corner and saw him standing outside the gates of Hall Fourteen. Well, this was awkward. I couldn't stand this anymore. I almost fell over in shock. I watched him go. He spoke harshly, stabbing a finger in my direction. He ignored me. I slowly retracted my hand until the underside of the umbrella was touching the top of my head. Maybe I had been superficial. He was glaring at me. Because, ultimately, the most important thing was for him to be happy. I jumped. He ran a palm over his face, looking like he would like nothing better in the world than to strangle some sense into me. I snapped. I admitted grudgingly. I muttered mutinously. It was… the coldest kiss I'd had so far. It wasn't the most passionate, or the most perfect, or the most skilful kiss I'd ever experienced. I discovered I was also drenched by the time we both ran out of breath and pulled away. As it turned out, he didn't need any advice on how to win a girl over, after all. Certain parts of this story are based off true incidents. Oh, don't get me wrong. I guess I hadn't been subtle enough, though, because my target was currently staring at me across the room. Though, he did look really good when he was being this happy. Alright, so that was an exaggeration. I looked at him again. Still, I supposed he looked good enough to warrant such a healthy ego. Speaking of whom had turned back to his friend while I was pondering the intricate mysteries of his blue eyes. I said, mostly to myself, because let's face it – the only reason I was sitting on the couch checking out cute blond-haired, blue-eyed guys was because I was at a party alone. Diagnosis was the first step to finding the cure for the sickness. A couple tequila shots later – okay, I lied, I only had one measly shot – I was living it up as the center of attention of the party. That sounded wrong. Whenever one of them glanced back, I would hide myself behind the nearest lamp-post or telephone pole. They let me follow them for as far as the main entrance of Halls of Residence Fourteen.

Though, he did look really good when he was being this happy. Alright, so that was an exaggeration. I looked at him again. Still, I supposed he looked good enough to warrant such a healthy ego. Speaking of whom had turned back to his friend while I was pondering the intricate mysteries of his blue eyes. I said, mostly to myself, because let's face it – the only reason I was sitting on the couch checking out cute blond-haired, blue-eyed guys was because I was at a party alone. Diagnosis was the first step to finding the cure for the sickness. A couple tequila shots later – okay, I lied, I only had one measly shot – I was living it up as the center of attention of the party. That sounded wrong. Whenever one of them glanced back, I would hide myself behind the nearest lamp-post or telephone pole. They let me follow them for as far as the main entrance of Halls of Residence Fourteen. There was the sound of the metal gate opening and I was mentally congratulating myself on a stalk well done when something happened to send my satisfaction down the drain. Sobering up all of a sudden, I sank to the ground. For some reason, Blue Eyes started popping up everywhere I went. I stared at her. And here came the familiar eye-roll. I threw a pillow at her. I said, with a little bit of wonder. His expression as he looked down on me was a mixture of a smile and a frown. Belatedly, I realized his phone had been vibrating. he divulged, smiling just the slightest bit. I said proudly, then paused. He was smiling, though. He grinned. I was kidding, of course. …Maybe. But he didn't seem to mind that I was monopolizing a little bit of his time almost every day. On our third meet-up, I realized we'd never formally introduced ourselves to each other. On one hand, it was cool that he had a nickname for me. Half an hour and a cup of iced latte later, I was a little drunk on coffee. There was a little silence as he digested what I'd just said. He lounged back in his seat, raising his cup to his lips before he remembered that it was empty. Then we went on another one of our tangents. Or maybe, I admitted to myself with a sinking feeling, the hypothetical mystery girl in this case wasn't so hypothetical after all. I said as the two of them stood up to accommodate my arrival. He trailed off, as if he had no idea how to categorize me. I think that was the moment I felt that little bit of hope in my chest shrivel up and die. I looked at Maddy again. Not that I would even want to. Coward. I was trying my hardest not to look up into his eyes. His tone had lightened considerably. Gosh, why was he so persistent? I made to sound like I was giggling, even though I'd never felt less like it in my entire life. I said loftily, knowing this would make him go away. I did an about-turn and went back the way I'd come from. Of course I would be. Moping around the room could hardly be constituted as 'ruining my life'. She didn't agree, judging by the way she ignored me and barreled on. But my heart still wasn't convinced. He'd once told me he hated being out in the rain. Therefore, I was understandably horrified when I rounded the corner and saw him standing outside the gates of Hall Fourteen. Well, this was awkward. I couldn't stand this anymore. I almost fell over in shock. I watched him go. He spoke harshly, stabbing a finger in my direction. He ignored me. I slowly retracted my hand until the underside of the umbrella was touching the top of my head. Maybe I had been superficial. He was glaring at me. Because, ultimately, the most important thing was for him to be happy. I jumped. He ran a palm over his face, looking like he would like nothing better in the world than to strangle some sense into me. I snapped. I admitted grudgingly. I muttered mutinously. It was… the coldest kiss I'd had so far. It wasn't the most passionate, or the most perfect, or the most skilful kiss I'd ever experienced.

Therefore, I was understandably horrified when I rounded the corner and saw him standing outside the gates of Hall Fourteen. Well, this was awkward. I couldn't stand this anymore. I almost fell over in shock. I watched him go. He spoke harshly, stabbing a finger in my direction. He ignored me. I slowly retracted my hand until the underside of the umbrella was touching the top of my head. Maybe I had been superficial. He was glaring at me. Because, ultimately, the most important thing was for him to be happy. I jumped. He ran a palm over his face, looking like he would like nothing better in the world than to strangle some sense into me. I snapped. I admitted grudgingly. I muttered mutinously. It was… the coldest kiss I'd had so far. It wasn't the most passionate, or the most perfect, or the most skilful kiss I'd ever experienced. I discovered I was also drenched by the time we both ran out of breath and pulled away. As it turned out, he didn't need any advice on how to win a girl over, after all. Certain parts of this story are based off true incidents. Oh, don't get me wrong. I guess I hadn't been subtle enough, though, because my target was currently staring at me across the room. Though, he did look really good when he was being this happy. Alright, so that was an exaggeration. I looked at him again. Still, I supposed he looked good enough to warrant such a healthy ego. Speaking of whom had turned back to his friend while I was pondering the intricate mysteries of his blue eyes. I said, mostly to myself, because let's face it – the only reason I was sitting on the couch checking out cute blond-haired, blue-eyed guys was because I was at a party alone. Diagnosis was the first step to finding the cure for the sickness. A couple tequila shots later – okay, I lied, I only had one measly shot – I was living it up as the center of attention of the party. That sounded wrong. Whenever one of them glanced back, I would hide myself behind the nearest lamp-post or telephone pole. They let me follow them for as far as the main entrance of Halls of Residence Fourteen. There was the sound of the metal gate opening and I was mentally congratulating myself on a stalk well done when something happened to send my satisfaction down the drain. Sobering up all of a sudden, I sank to the ground. For some reason, Blue Eyes started popping up everywhere I went. I stared at her. And here came the familiar eye-roll. I threw a pillow at her. I said, with a little bit of wonder. His expression as he looked down on me was a mixture of a smile and a frown. Belatedly, I realized his phone had been vibrating. he divulged, smiling just the slightest bit. I said proudly, then paused. He was smiling, though. He grinned. I was kidding, of course. …Maybe. But he didn't seem to mind that I was monopolizing a little bit of his time almost every day. On our third meet-up, I realized we'd never formally introduced ourselves to each other. On one hand, it was cool that he had a nickname for me. Half an hour and a cup of iced latte later, I was a little drunk on coffee. There was a little silence as he digested what I'd just said. He lounged back in his seat, raising his cup to his lips before he remembered that it was empty. Then we went on another one of our tangents. Or maybe, I admitted to myself with a sinking feeling, the hypothetical mystery girl in this case wasn't so hypothetical after all. I said as the two of them stood up to accommodate my arrival. He trailed off, as if he had no idea how to categorize me. I think that was the moment I felt that little bit of hope in my chest shrivel up and die. I looked at Maddy again. Not that I would even want to. Coward. I was trying my hardest not to look up into his eyes. His tone had lightened considerably. Gosh, why was he so persistent? I made to sound like I was giggling, even though I'd never felt less like it in my entire life. I said loftily, knowing this would make him go away. I did an about-turn and went back the way I'd come from. Of course I would be. Moping around the room could hardly be constituted as 'ruining my life'.

Every unmated girl in the city was in love with Aiden Norwood. Whenever he entered a room, everyone couldn't ignore him. I came to the river because it was the only place I could have some peace and clarity. Anyway, my friends started pairing-up so they would have a fuck-buddy for the upcoming Season. That's right. So to escape all that pressure, I went to the river. He was leaning on the tree trunk next to mine, facing the river like I did. I returned my eyes to the water. The sudden fish that jumped out of the water and right back into it snapped me out of my daydreaming and reminded me of another reason I had to come here. My parents weren't happy with my aspirations in life. I love my parents. Sighing, I stopped sketching, realizing I finished the outlines. I'd just started another sketch when I realized someone was watching me. Chancing a look, I saw him nodding at me in some sort of acknowledgement and then he stood up to his full six foot five height. It wasn't an everyday-event to see the alpha out of the Pack House, the headquarters of every pack's management and the alpha and his advisors and helpers. But I didn't give it much thought. Having no choice but to go back home now, I gathered my stuff and made my way out of the park, returning back to reality. The moment he did, Melissa couldn't move her eyes away from his beautiful green ones. Mere weeks later they mated. A few years after she gave birth, Melissa was on her way back from the hospital when she watched something abnormal; a tiny baby, a newborn, wrapped in a thin blanket and laying in an abandoned carriage. The baby is – or rather, was me. Anyway, my mother was waiting for me with a very sour face. Thankfully, I was a good liar, and so my mother's face softened and she nodded. It was a plausible explanation, I guess, but for some reason I didn't think it was the cause. But what did I know? In my room, I sat at my desk, pulled out the sketching notebook and started coloring the sketches using a brand-new pack of crayons. Dialing her number, I waited for her to pick up. I said, faking excitement while I grimaced. she said, proud to have surprised the hell out of me. Sighing for the thousandth time today, I leaned my head down on the desk, letting the cool air of late November caress me. Every unmated girl in the city was in love with Aiden Norwood.

Chancing a look, I saw him nodding at me in some sort of acknowledgement and then he stood up to his full six foot five height. It wasn't an everyday-event to see the alpha out of the Pack House, the headquarters of every pack's management and the alpha and his advisors and helpers. But I didn't give it much thought. Having no choice but to go back home now, I gathered my stuff and made my way out of the park, returning back to reality. The moment he did, Melissa couldn't move her eyes away from his beautiful green ones. Mere weeks later they mated. A few years after she gave birth, Melissa was on her way back from the hospital when she watched something abnormal; a tiny baby, a newborn, wrapped in a thin blanket and laying in an abandoned carriage. The baby is – or rather, was me. Anyway, my mother was waiting for me with a very sour face. Thankfully, I was a good liar, and so my mother's face softened and she nodded. It was a plausible explanation, I guess, but for some reason I didn't think it was the cause. But what did I know? In my room, I sat at my desk, pulled out the sketching notebook and started coloring the sketches using a brand-new pack of crayons. Dialing her number, I waited for her to pick up. I said, faking excitement while I grimaced. she said, proud to have surprised the hell out of me. Sighing for the thousandth time today, I leaned my head down on the desk, letting the cool air of late November caress me. Every unmated girl in the city was in love with Aiden Norwood. Whenever he entered a room, everyone couldn't ignore him. I came to the river because it was the only place I could have some peace and clarity. Anyway, my friends started pairing-up so they would have a fuck-buddy for the upcoming Season. That's right. So to escape all that pressure, I went to the river. He was leaning on the tree trunk next to mine, facing the river like I did. I returned my eyes to the water. The sudden fish that jumped out of the water and right back into it snapped me out of my daydreaming and reminded me of another reason I had to come here.

Sighing for the thousandth time today, I leaned my head down on the desk, letting the cool air of late November caress me. Every unmated girl in the city was in love with Aiden Norwood. Whenever he entered a room, everyone couldn't ignore him. I came to the river because it was the only place I could have some peace and clarity. Anyway, my friends started pairing-up so they would have a fuck-buddy for the upcoming Season. That's right. So to escape all that pressure, I went to the river. He was leaning on the tree trunk next to mine, facing the river like I did. I returned my eyes to the water. The sudden fish that jumped out of the water and right back into it snapped me out of my daydreaming and reminded me of another reason I had to come here. My parents weren't happy with my aspirations in life. I love my parents. Sighing, I stopped sketching, realizing I finished the outlines. I'd just started another sketch when I realized someone was watching me. Chancing a look, I saw him nodding at me in some sort of acknowledgement and then he stood up to his full six foot five height. It wasn't an everyday-event to see the alpha out of the Pack House, the headquarters of every pack's management and the alpha and his advisors and helpers. But I didn't give it much thought. Having no choice but to go back home now, I gathered my stuff and made my way out of the park, returning back to reality. The moment he did, Melissa couldn't move her eyes away from his beautiful green ones. Mere weeks later they mated. A few years after she gave birth, Melissa was on her way back from the hospital when she watched something abnormal; a tiny baby, a newborn, wrapped in a thin blanket and laying in an abandoned carriage. The baby is – or rather, was me. Anyway, my mother was waiting for me with a very sour face. Thankfully, I was a good liar, and so my mother's face softened and she nodded. It was a plausible explanation, I guess, but for some reason I didn't think it was the cause. But what did I know?
