In other words, to prevent the boys from tearing apart his precious building with their cheerful mischief before they graduated. Shaking his head slowly, he flipped through the papers. The boy had obviously been through hard times, arriving just this morning with only a tiny banged up suitcase and his letter of acceptance. He'd seen too many spoiled, rich brats and it was nice to see someone different for a change. .

She'd managed to intercept the mail and she'd nearly wept with relief at the sight of the thick envelope. Standing before the nondescript oak door, she quickly smoothed down her short hair, which she had cropped off awkwardly with a pair of shears, and reached out for the doorknob.

There was a moment of some emotion that I could never quite place as we stared at each other. What the hell was going on there. Brody and I—let's just say we didn't get on real well. Brody! I was all for feminism and everything, but I could not, for the life of me, pretend to be interested in those things. That was it. Once she pulled this off, I discovered that there was underwear hidden, well, underneath it. Then she turned toward the window and saw me. Then, inexplicably, she smiled and pulled on her jeans. I almost choked on my own spit right then, thinking about Felicia in the shower. She'd mouthed at me. She seemed to stifle a laugh as she tossed the blue hoodie to the floor. How could I enjoy looking at her that much? she asked, softly so our parents wouldn't hear. Epic failure, for sure. I never understood why people would do that. They cared about each other no matter what the problem was that made them break up time and time again. When dad stopped calling for me and my sister McKenzie while he knew mom was at work. He's really good at that sort of psychiatry thing. Reading made me forget about my life for a moment, and I was able to focus on the misery of someone else's for once. Nick was cool like that; he just got when you needed to be left alone. But I'm sure you'll hear all about that some other time. We were both just… there. Review, please? Despite Australia being in the midst of a decade long drought, we were lucky to not be a part of it. It was trotting out well, confidently, and only pricked her ears as I drew closer. But dad didn't normally ask me to do something like this by myself. She was no young thing at eighteen years old, but she wasn't all that old either. Same height, same face, same markings… you get the point. Plus, I hadn't ridden her in a while and she was getting fat from doing nothing but eating the lush grass all day. I was just happy I had the two dogs with me to help. I let myself roll back on my heels until I was sitting on my bottom on the river rocks, and enjoyed the relief the shade of the trees brought. I sprung upright, ignoring the water filling my boots as I held my hands up in front of me. Did he spend two hours a day ironing one set of clothes to perfection? I couldn't have just forgotten his face because… seriously, how could you miss someone that perfect? But he seemed so indifferent to everything around him, like there was a great mask barring his inner emotions. And why wasn't he leaving? He still hadn't spoken a word. Nothing stays that clean on a farm out here. I was a pretty angry child, but at almost twenty-one, I was much more level headed. I shifted my gaze to his hand, and stumbled back a step, almost ending up in the river once again. I gawked at it. What had I always wanted to see or do? I added. Thanks!

It was trotting out well, confidently, and only pricked her ears as I drew closer. But dad didn't normally ask me to do something like this by myself. She was no young thing at eighteen years old, but she wasn't all that old either. Same height, same face, same markings… you get the point. Plus, I hadn't ridden her in a while and she was getting fat from doing nothing but eating the lush grass all day. I was just happy I had the two dogs with me to help. I let myself roll back on my heels until I was sitting on my bottom on the river rocks, and enjoyed the relief the shade of the trees brought. I sprung upright, ignoring the water filling my boots as I held my hands up in front of me. Did he spend two hours a day ironing one set of clothes to perfection?

As in I'm-holding-onto-my-brother's-prized-baseball-bat-in-front-of-Ryan's-car angry. And worst of all, when he told me that after that concert him and Carrie had sex in the back of his car, I didn't yell. That's how meek I am. He ended up liking me and thought my wounded-puppy routine was cute. She stays up late telling me about all the guys she's slept with and how she doesn't believe in love but believes in loving sex. Then I patted myself on the back for being so forgiving and such a wonderful person. The big sister is supposed to be the conniving bitch but she controls me. When I flopped into the seat he looked me up and down and told me I looked awful. I would add later. He uses it to get what he wants. I opened the trunk of my car to put my book bag away when I saw it. And suddenly my feet began moving back towards the vehicle and I raised the bat above my head, ready to strike. Not necessarily because I wanted to stay together with him, as I obviously was more angry than I thought, but there was no way I'd let myself get dumped by the guy who cheated on me. Instead his chin was covered by stubble. In one swift moment he pulled a cigarette out, plopped it on the side of his mouth, and lit up. All I wanted was to get home, eat a pint of ice cream, then maybe throw my pillows around. Obviously he smoked. Not too tight, not too loose. I wasn't too pleased to know either. Probably a whole foot taller than I was. My sister is a sex kitten but I am definitely not. Any other girl would have dumped her boyfriend on the spot but I had to stupidly tell Ryan that it was a-okay. He was arrested! Probably from punching walls. They don't argue with me because I've never changed. I didn't want to, I swear, but who am I to refuse a guy who has been arrested? I didn't have time to worry about it because he continued on his lecture. Afterwards you can watch a sappy romance movie, I'll even go with you if you want company, although I prefer action flicks if you're feeling like paying me back for this advice. Normally I'm not a fan of the smell of smoke, but it came off him in a musky, cologne-like fragrance. He hadn't removed his hand from my cheek and for the first time since meeting Ryan I felt butterflies in my stomach. From the one who got arrested! They walked off, a picture-like couple from a movie. And he was my boyfriend. Suddenly I was a girl on a mission. I tied my hair into a pony-tail and pulled up my sleeves. I kept hitting the car until I was tired and it barely resembled the nice car it once was. I rolled it up and smiled it satisfaction. It was totally everything I used to be. He said breathlessly. When we were staring eye to eye I said,  With that I kissed him. It was…perfect. I saw Ryan running down the hill, horrified at the state of his car. I must look like Aphrodite after Peter's kiss. She wiggled her fingers at him but he ignored her. I grinned right back, suddenly feeling as if my teeth were just as bright as Carrie's. So much for the dramatic side of me. he repeated.

Then I patted myself on the back for being so forgiving and such a wonderful person. The big sister is supposed to be the conniving bitch but she controls me. When I flopped into the seat he looked me up and down and told me I looked awful. I would add later. He uses it to get what he wants. I opened the trunk of my car to put my book bag away when I saw it. And suddenly my feet began moving back towards the vehicle and I raised the bat above my head, ready to strike. Not necessarily because I wanted to stay together with him, as I obviously was more angry than I thought, but there was no way I'd let myself get dumped by the guy who cheated on me. Instead his chin was covered by stubble. In one swift moment he pulled a cigarette out, plopped it on the side of his mouth, and lit up. All I wanted was to get home, eat a pint of ice cream, then maybe throw my pillows around. Obviously he smoked. Not too tight, not too loose. I wasn't too pleased to know either. Probably a whole foot taller than I was. My sister is a sex kitten but I am definitely not. Any other girl would have dumped her boyfriend on the spot but I had to stupidly tell Ryan that it was a-okay. He was arrested! Probably from punching walls.

I didn't have time to worry about it because he continued on his lecture. Afterwards you can watch a sappy romance movie, I'll even go with you if you want company, although I prefer action flicks if you're feeling like paying me back for this advice. Normally I'm not a fan of the smell of smoke, but it came off him in a musky, cologne-like fragrance. He hadn't removed his hand from my cheek and for the first time since meeting Ryan I felt butterflies in my stomach. From the one who got arrested! They walked off, a picture-like couple from a movie. And he was my boyfriend. Suddenly I was a girl on a mission. I tied my hair into a pony-tail and pulled up my sleeves. I kept hitting the car until I was tired and it barely resembled the nice car it once was. I rolled it up and smiled it satisfaction. It was totally everything I used to be. He said breathlessly. When we were staring eye to eye I said,  With that I kissed him. It was…perfect. I saw Ryan running down the hill, horrified at the state of his car. I must look like Aphrodite after Peter's kiss. She wiggled her fingers at him but he ignored her. I grinned right back, suddenly feeling as if my teeth were just as bright as Carrie's. So much for the dramatic side of me. he repeated. Let me know what you think. They cheered him on, mentioning how I was too sweet to ever get angry at him. As in I'm-holding-onto-my-brother's-prized-baseball-bat-in-front-of-Ryan's-car angry.

I opened the trunk of my car to put my book bag away when I saw it. And suddenly my feet began moving back towards the vehicle and I raised the bat above my head, ready to strike. Not necessarily because I wanted to stay together with him, as I obviously was more angry than I thought, but there was no way I'd let myself get dumped by the guy who cheated on me. Instead his chin was covered by stubble. In one swift moment he pulled a cigarette out, plopped it on the side of his mouth, and lit up. All I wanted was to get home, eat a pint of ice cream, then maybe throw my pillows around. Obviously he smoked. Not too tight, not too loose. I wasn't too pleased to know either. Probably a whole foot taller than I was. My sister is a sex kitten but I am definitely not. Any other girl would have dumped her boyfriend on the spot but I had to stupidly tell Ryan that it was a-okay. He was arrested! Probably from punching walls. They don't argue with me because I've never changed. I didn't want to, I swear, but who am I to refuse a guy who has been arrested? I didn't have time to worry about it because he continued on his lecture.

He hadn't removed his hand from my cheek and for the first time since meeting Ryan I felt butterflies in my stomach. From the one who got arrested! They walked off, a picture-like couple from a movie. And he was my boyfriend. Suddenly I was a girl on a mission. I tied my hair into a pony-tail and pulled up my sleeves. I kept hitting the car until I was tired and it barely resembled the nice car it once was. I rolled it up and smiled it satisfaction. It was totally everything I used to be. He said breathlessly. When we were staring eye to eye I said,  With that I kissed him. It was…perfect. I saw Ryan running down the hill, horrified at the state of his car. I must look like Aphrodite after Peter's kiss. She wiggled her fingers at him but he ignored her. I grinned right back, suddenly feeling as if my teeth were just as bright as Carrie's. So much for the dramatic side of me. he repeated. Let me know what you think. They cheered him on, mentioning how I was too sweet to ever get angry at him. As in I'm-holding-onto-my-brother's-prized-baseball-bat-in-front-of-Ryan's-car angry. And worst of all, when he told me that after that concert him and Carrie had sex in the back of his car, I didn't yell. That's how meek I am. He ended up liking me and thought my wounded-puppy routine was cute. She stays up late telling me about all the guys she's slept with and how she doesn't believe in love but believes in loving sex.

I feared long speeches and mediocre performances were next to come and gratefully accepted a champagne flute from a waiter who appeared at my side. The lights blinked and the tables began to fill up. I hadn't been expecting… Well, I'm not sure what I had been expecting, but certainly not this! She exclaimed, punching the air triumphantly. I retrieved a few more coins and dumped them on the table.

I hadn't been expecting… Well, I'm not sure what I had been expecting, but certainly not this! Gosh, I was way more subtle than that. Was he laughing at me? It was like a sledgehammer swung down out of nowhere and hit you right in the heart. That, coupled with the way his entire face lit up when he laughed, was almost enough to pull me across the room, place myself next to him, and introduce myself. I froze under the onslaught of that blue gaze and he grinned. I hoped that was his real eye color, because if it wasn't, I was going to be so pissed. That was all. The main question was not why I'd gone alone, but why I was still alone. But first, I needed a drink. Still, I had met some nice new people and done a fair bit of flailing about on the dance floor. But on the whole journey back, I was ten paces behind him and his friend. Even so, they made no move to stop me. I was too busy trying to keep upright and in the shadows while watching the two of them enter their block. The gate clanged shut but I could still hear the sound of their laughter. As it turned out, the odds were very much against me indeed. I saw him at the in-campus grocery store; on the campus shuttle bus; in the cafeteria… Everywhere. Not… this. she sighed. Sort of. I should've feigned ignorance and escaped as soon as I could have. But he had really nice cheekbones and a firm jaw-line. I wondered what his ringtone sounded like. Must've been the European blood in him. Huh. he said, said eyes dancing when I looked into them. So that, you know, he wouldn't think I was only good at stalking. Probably. He was always out with his friends. I did wonder why he was willing to take the time out to talk to someone he considered a stalker, but never brought up the topic. He'd given me his name the day we'd met, but I was so used to referring to him as 'Blue Eyes' that I hadn't put much effort into remembering his real name. But of course, he would never let me forget it. I swear. I don't assume every German has blue eyes, do I? he said. Hadn't I given him enough openings? As I slowly walked towards them, I observed that his entire body was turned towards her and his whole face was lit up. I would say hi politely, smile at them, and, after an appropriate amount of time, calmly leave. Even the label 'friend' – heck, even 'a stalker I've been talking to for five weeks now' – would've been better than nothing. Imagine fantasizing about being the girl he was head over heels for – what were the chances of that happening, right? I couldn't get in the way of that. I could find a replacement stalkee in no time. Until he appeared out of nowhere while I was heading for tutorial. I laughed, but it came out sounding a little false. He laughed. So that I could pump up his balloon of a male ego? I cast a panicked glance around and spotted some random guy with large white headphones… My savior. Right? I'd be fine after a few hours' rest. Plus, I didn't really like chocolate anyway. I told her as much. Someday. Besides, I reasoned, the chances of running into him in this rain were close to none. He was the sunshine kind of boy. I was considering ducking back round the corner and heading another way when he turned and caught sight of me. I probably deserved it, considering my last words to him. I changed the subject. I felt so bad for him that I couldn't find it in me to feel happy that he was single again. He looked like he'd just thought of something that had pissed him off and resolved his determination at the same time. And that he was going to catch a cold if he stayed out in the rain like that. he said. He didn't have to go all nasty like that. He could have freakish rainbow-colored eyes for all I cared – I would still feel the same way about him. Well, not exactly under, because he was too tall for it to fit directly over his head. She was perfect for him. He must've been freezing out there in the rain. The third time was the longest yet. I also didn't like it that I was the reason he was so frustrated. Mushy scenes like these really weren't my cup of tea. I was starting to feel bad now. Then he tangled a hand in my hair and pulled me closer to kiss me properly, and I forgot about all the cold for a little while. But this kiss, right here, right now, with the right guy – it surely was the best I'd ever had. I would stand out in the rain for an hour if that was all it took to feel this way, to have him look at me this way – all of the time. But enough about me. Oh, well! Gosh, I was way more subtle than that. Was he laughing at me? It was like a sledgehammer swung down out of nowhere and hit you right in the heart.

I cast a panicked glance around and spotted some random guy with large white headphones… My savior. Right? I'd be fine after a few hours' rest. Plus, I didn't really like chocolate anyway. I told her as much. Someday. Besides, I reasoned, the chances of running into him in this rain were close to none. He was the sunshine kind of boy. I was considering ducking back round the corner and heading another way when he turned and caught sight of me. I probably deserved it, considering my last words to him. I changed the subject. I felt so bad for him that I couldn't find it in me to feel happy that he was single again. He looked like he'd just thought of something that had pissed him off and resolved his determination at the same time. And that he was going to catch a cold if he stayed out in the rain like that. he said. He didn't have to go all nasty like that. He could have freakish rainbow-colored eyes for all I cared – I would still feel the same way about him. Well, not exactly under, because he was too tall for it to fit directly over his head. She was perfect for him. He must've been freezing out there in the rain. The third time was the longest yet. I also didn't like it that I was the reason he was so frustrated. Mushy scenes like these really weren't my cup of tea. I was starting to feel bad now. Then he tangled a hand in my hair and pulled me closer to kiss me properly, and I forgot about all the cold for a little while. But this kiss, right here, right now, with the right guy – it surely was the best I'd ever had. I would stand out in the rain for an hour if that was all it took to feel this way, to have him look at me this way – all of the time. But enough about me. Oh, well! Gosh, I was way more subtle than that. Was he laughing at me? It was like a sledgehammer swung down out of nowhere and hit you right in the heart. That, coupled with the way his entire face lit up when he laughed, was almost enough to pull me across the room, place myself next to him, and introduce myself. I froze under the onslaught of that blue gaze and he grinned. I hoped that was his real eye color, because if it wasn't, I was going to be so pissed. That was all. The main question was not why I'd gone alone, but why I was still alone. But first, I needed a drink. Still, I had met some nice new people and done a fair bit of flailing about on the dance floor. But on the whole journey back, I was ten paces behind him and his friend. Even so, they made no move to stop me. I was too busy trying to keep upright and in the shadows while watching the two of them enter their block. The gate clanged shut but I could still hear the sound of their laughter. As it turned out, the odds were very much against me indeed. I saw him at the in-campus grocery store; on the campus shuttle bus; in the cafeteria… Everywhere. Not… this. she sighed. Sort of. I should've feigned ignorance and escaped as soon as I could have. But he had really nice cheekbones and a firm jaw-line. I wondered what his ringtone sounded like. Must've been the European blood in him. Huh. he said, said eyes dancing when I looked into them. So that, you know, he wouldn't think I was only good at stalking. Probably. He was always out with his friends. I did wonder why he was willing to take the time out to talk to someone he considered a stalker, but never brought up the topic. He'd given me his name the day we'd met, but I was so used to referring to him as 'Blue Eyes' that I hadn't put much effort into remembering his real name. But of course, he would never let me forget it. I swear. I don't assume every German has blue eyes, do I? he said. Hadn't I given him enough openings? As I slowly walked towards them, I observed that his entire body was turned towards her and his whole face was lit up. I would say hi politely, smile at them, and, after an appropriate amount of time, calmly leave. Even the label 'friend' – heck, even 'a stalker I've been talking to for five weeks now' – would've been better than nothing.

Mushy scenes like these really weren't my cup of tea. I was starting to feel bad now. Then he tangled a hand in my hair and pulled me closer to kiss me properly, and I forgot about all the cold for a little while. But this kiss, right here, right now, with the right guy – it surely was the best I'd ever had. I would stand out in the rain for an hour if that was all it took to feel this way, to have him look at me this way – all of the time. But enough about me. Oh, well! Gosh, I was way more subtle than that. Was he laughing at me? It was like a sledgehammer swung down out of nowhere and hit you right in the heart. That, coupled with the way his entire face lit up when he laughed, was almost enough to pull me across the room, place myself next to him, and introduce myself. I froze under the onslaught of that blue gaze and he grinned. I hoped that was his real eye color, because if it wasn't, I was going to be so pissed. That was all. The main question was not why I'd gone alone, but why I was still alone. But first, I needed a drink. Still, I had met some nice new people and done a fair bit of flailing about on the dance floor. But on the whole journey back, I was ten paces behind him and his friend. Even so, they made no move to stop me. I was too busy trying to keep upright and in the shadows while watching the two of them enter their block. The gate clanged shut but I could still hear the sound of their laughter. As it turned out, the odds were very much against me indeed. I saw him at the in-campus grocery store; on the campus shuttle bus; in the cafeteria… Everywhere. Not… this. she sighed. Sort of. I should've feigned ignorance and escaped as soon as I could have. But he had really nice cheekbones and a firm jaw-line. I wondered what his ringtone sounded like. Must've been the European blood in him. Huh. he said, said eyes dancing when I looked into them. So that, you know, he wouldn't think I was only good at stalking. Probably. He was always out with his friends. I did wonder why he was willing to take the time out to talk to someone he considered a stalker, but never brought up the topic. He'd given me his name the day we'd met, but I was so used to referring to him as 'Blue Eyes' that I hadn't put much effort into remembering his real name. But of course, he would never let me forget it. I swear. I don't assume every German has blue eyes, do I? he said. Hadn't I given him enough openings? As I slowly walked towards them, I observed that his entire body was turned towards her and his whole face was lit up. I would say hi politely, smile at them, and, after an appropriate amount of time, calmly leave. Even the label 'friend' – heck, even 'a stalker I've been talking to for five weeks now' – would've been better than nothing. Imagine fantasizing about being the girl he was head over heels for – what were the chances of that happening, right? I couldn't get in the way of that. I could find a replacement stalkee in no time. Until he appeared out of nowhere while I was heading for tutorial. I laughed, but it came out sounding a little false. He laughed. So that I could pump up his balloon of a male ego? I cast a panicked glance around and spotted some random guy with large white headphones… My savior. Right? I'd be fine after a few hours' rest. Plus, I didn't really like chocolate anyway. I told her as much. Someday. Besides, I reasoned, the chances of running into him in this rain were close to none. He was the sunshine kind of boy. I was considering ducking back round the corner and heading another way when he turned and caught sight of me. I probably deserved it, considering my last words to him. I changed the subject. I felt so bad for him that I couldn't find it in me to feel happy that he was single again. He looked like he'd just thought of something that had pissed him off and resolved his determination at the same time. And that he was going to catch a cold if he stayed out in the rain like that. he said. He didn't have to go all nasty like that. He could have freakish rainbow-colored eyes for all I cared – I would still feel the same way about him. Well, not exactly under, because he was too tall for it to fit directly over his head.

But on the whole journey back, I was ten paces behind him and his friend. Even so, they made no move to stop me. I was too busy trying to keep upright and in the shadows while watching the two of them enter their block. The gate clanged shut but I could still hear the sound of their laughter. As it turned out, the odds were very much against me indeed. I saw him at the in-campus grocery store; on the campus shuttle bus; in the cafeteria… Everywhere. Not… this. she sighed. Sort of. I should've feigned ignorance and escaped as soon as I could have. But he had really nice cheekbones and a firm jaw-line. I wondered what his ringtone sounded like. Must've been the European blood in him. Huh. he said, said eyes dancing when I looked into them. So that, you know, he wouldn't think I was only good at stalking. Probably. He was always out with his friends. I did wonder why he was willing to take the time out to talk to someone he considered a stalker, but never brought up the topic. He'd given me his name the day we'd met, but I was so used to referring to him as 'Blue Eyes' that I hadn't put much effort into remembering his real name. But of course, he would never let me forget it. I swear. I don't assume every German has blue eyes, do I? he said. Hadn't I given him enough openings? As I slowly walked towards them, I observed that his entire body was turned towards her and his whole face was lit up. I would say hi politely, smile at them, and, after an appropriate amount of time, calmly leave. Even the label 'friend' – heck, even 'a stalker I've been talking to for five weeks now' – would've been better than nothing. Imagine fantasizing about being the girl he was head over heels for – what were the chances of that happening, right? I couldn't get in the way of that. I could find a replacement stalkee in no time. Until he appeared out of nowhere while I was heading for tutorial. I laughed, but it came out sounding a little false. He laughed. So that I could pump up his balloon of a male ego? I cast a panicked glance around and spotted some random guy with large white headphones… My savior. Right? I'd be fine after a few hours' rest. Plus, I didn't really like chocolate anyway. I told her as much. Someday. Besides, I reasoned, the chances of running into him in this rain were close to none. He was the sunshine kind of boy. I was considering ducking back round the corner and heading another way when he turned and caught sight of me. I probably deserved it, considering my last words to him. I changed the subject. I felt so bad for him that I couldn't find it in me to feel happy that he was single again. He looked like he'd just thought of something that had pissed him off and resolved his determination at the same time. And that he was going to catch a cold if he stayed out in the rain like that. he said. He didn't have to go all nasty like that. He could have freakish rainbow-colored eyes for all I cared – I would still feel the same way about him. Well, not exactly under, because he was too tall for it to fit directly over his head. She was perfect for him. He must've been freezing out there in the rain. The third time was the longest yet. I also didn't like it that I was the reason he was so frustrated. Mushy scenes like these really weren't my cup of tea. I was starting to feel bad now. Then he tangled a hand in my hair and pulled me closer to kiss me properly, and I forgot about all the cold for a little while. But this kiss, right here, right now, with the right guy – it surely was the best I'd ever had. I would stand out in the rain for an hour if that was all it took to feel this way, to have him look at me this way – all of the time. But enough about me. Oh, well! Gosh, I was way more subtle than that. Was he laughing at me? It was like a sledgehammer swung down out of nowhere and hit you right in the heart. That, coupled with the way his entire face lit up when he laughed, was almost enough to pull me across the room, place myself next to him, and introduce myself. I froze under the onslaught of that blue gaze and he grinned. I hoped that was his real eye color, because if it wasn't, I was going to be so pissed. That was all.

Add in the fact he's the alpha of one of the top three packs in the entire US, and girls practically melted in his presence. Alphas needed - and lusted after - a woman, a mate, to continue his legacy, and no man would do. Although every rule has an exception. Michelle hadn't understood why, telling me I'm being picky, and I found I couldn't tell her. But I cherished mine with my whole hear, wanting to give my first time to my mate, whoever it was. At least, it was a secret for me, because from time to time I could see people coming to the river to wonder about just like I did. He really was somewhere else right now. I wouldn't blame him if he did; being an alpha is one heck of a job, especially the alpha of the second biggest pack in the States. It allowed me to empty my mind of everything, and my body relaxed as the motions of my sketching hand became almost fluid, in a way. Which was why now every time they looked at me they had disappointment written all over their face. Once I had enough money in my savings, I was going to open my own gallery, and they would see how wrong they were with assuming that artists end up poor and lonely. It was nice for a ten-minutes-long sketch, and I smiled briefly to myself. Since I didn't intend to do either, my only option was to look away before it was too late and he would've interpreted the meaning of the gaze for me. Even his slight crooked nose didn't interfere with his sexy, amazing looks. The fact that he was by the river today was a rare sight, especially since I, a commoner, saw him. If a word got out about this, Aiden's fan club would go ballistic. And so for a few days, she just watched him, brushed his brown hair from time to time, for he was still unconscious and couldn't do so himself, and waited for him to open his eyes. He was her mate. And so she mated him. She tried to track down the baby's parents, but no one knew whom she belonged to, and so Melissa ended up adopting the baby. I still loved her wholeheartedly, of course, but I've always wanted to know who my biological parents were so I could counter them as to why did they think it was appropriate to abandon their child. That's when I saw her making a face at me. Not that it was any of my business. He seemed to have much more serious problems than that. I couldn't possibly know what went through the mind of a man in his late twenties, let alone an alpha. She'd sent it about five minutes ago. she gushed as a greeting. Since she's still nineteen, her dream had come true. Yeah, it was a surprise.

I couldn't possibly know what went through the mind of a man in his late twenties, let alone an alpha. She'd sent it about five minutes ago. she gushed as a greeting. Since she's still nineteen, her dream had come true. Yeah, it was a surprise. I could only hope this Season would be less worse than the others, that I would be able to keep my virginity intact, no matter how alluring the temptation is. Add in the fact he's the alpha of one of the top three packs in the entire US, and girls practically melted in his presence. Alphas needed - and lusted after - a woman, a mate, to continue his legacy, and no man would do. Although every rule has an exception. Michelle hadn't understood why, telling me I'm being picky, and I found I couldn't tell her. But I cherished mine with my whole hear, wanting to give my first time to my mate, whoever it was. At least, it was a secret for me, because from time to time I could see people coming to the river to wonder about just like I did. He really was somewhere else right now.

It was nice for a ten-minutes-long sketch, and I smiled briefly to myself. Since I didn't intend to do either, my only option was to look away before it was too late and he would've interpreted the meaning of the gaze for me. Even his slight crooked nose didn't interfere with his sexy, amazing looks. The fact that he was by the river today was a rare sight, especially since I, a commoner, saw him. If a word got out about this, Aiden's fan club would go ballistic. And so for a few days, she just watched him, brushed his brown hair from time to time, for he was still unconscious and couldn't do so himself, and waited for him to open his eyes. He was her mate. And so she mated him. She tried to track down the baby's parents, but no one knew whom she belonged to, and so Melissa ended up adopting the baby.

Add in the fact he's the alpha of one of the top three packs in the entire US, and girls practically melted in his presence. Alphas needed - and lusted after - a woman, a mate, to continue his legacy, and no man would do. Although every rule has an exception. Michelle hadn't understood why, telling me I'm being picky, and I found I couldn't tell her. But I cherished mine with my whole hear, wanting to give my first time to my mate, whoever it was. At least, it was a secret for me, because from time to time I could see people coming to the river to wonder about just like I did. He really was somewhere else right now. I wouldn't blame him if he did; being an alpha is one heck of a job, especially the alpha of the second biggest pack in the States. It allowed me to empty my mind of everything, and my body relaxed as the motions of my sketching hand became almost fluid, in a way. Which was why now every time they looked at me they had disappointment written all over their face. Once I had enough money in my savings, I was going to open my own gallery, and they would see how wrong they were with assuming that artists end up poor and lonely. It was nice for a ten-minutes-long sketch, and I smiled briefly to myself. Since I didn't intend to do either, my only option was to look away before it was too late and he would've interpreted the meaning of the gaze for me. Even his slight crooked nose didn't interfere with his sexy, amazing looks. The fact that he was by the river today was a rare sight, especially since I, a commoner, saw him. If a word got out about this, Aiden's fan club would go ballistic. And so for a few days, she just watched him, brushed his brown hair from time to time, for he was still unconscious and couldn't do so himself, and waited for him to open his eyes. He was her mate. And so she mated him. She tried to track down the baby's parents, but no one knew whom she belonged to, and so Melissa ended up adopting the baby. I still loved her wholeheartedly, of course, but I've always wanted to know who my biological parents were so I could counter them as to why did they think it was appropriate to abandon their child. That's when I saw her making a face at me. Not that it was any of my business. He seemed to have much more serious problems than that. I couldn't possibly know what went through the mind of a man in his late twenties, let alone an alpha. She'd sent it about five minutes ago. she gushed as a greeting.
